This document outlines all the events published on the brandâ€™s page by the LiveEngage Tag. These events provide customers transparency into the engagement and engagement window display flow, as well as a way to customize and act upon the obtained data. For example, a brand can hide an embedded div content only if the embedded engagement is displayed.
