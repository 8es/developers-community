### Introduction

The LiveEngage Messaging Interactions API retrieves the most up to date information available about contact center messaging interactions. This API makes it possible to search, filter and analyze data and transcripts of open and closed conversations.

The API returns the conversationâ€™s transcripts and all of its related metadata such as start time, end time, MCS, CSAT, summary, participated agents, the reason the conversation was closed etc.

This API supports the HTTP POST functionality (data retrieval), and all data is returned in JSON format. 

### Use Cases

* Extract all chat transcripts and accompanying data in order to integrate with any 3rd party application or database

* Extract a type of conversation (e.g. low CSAT score, high MCS) and take an action on them.

Example of interactive tool created based on Messaging Interactions API.  This example utilizes the information to filter, sort and read through various transcripts:
