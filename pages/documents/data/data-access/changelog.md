### June 18th, 2017

**Data Access job (version 1.0.0.57)**

Fixed a bug where some of the conversation records created by the Data Access job had missing conversation IDs.

**Data Access Schema (version 1.0.0.34)**  

The `isInteractive` boolean field was added to the transfer section. This fields indicates whether the transfer part of the conversation is interactive or not. _To clarify_, the `isInteractive` field in the main conversation section relates to the last part of the conversation.
