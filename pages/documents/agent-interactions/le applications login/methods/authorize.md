### Overview

This is a request to receive an authorization grant in the form of code from our Identity Broker Service (sentinel).
This code is later used in the [token request] (token.html){:target="_blank"} in order to recieve an access token that the application can use in order to interact with LE services.

This call should be made when the application does not posses a valid access token or refresh token.

**Response cookies**

**Note**:

In case the user does not have an active session, they will be redirected to the login page in order to authenticate and create a session. They will then be redirected back to the application redirection callback with code and with state, if one was provided in the request. In case the user already has an existing session, they will be redirected back to the application callback url, without passing through the login page first.

An example of a successful redirection to application:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
               &state=xyz
```

In case the request encountered an error, if account id, client id and redirection URL are valid, the user will be redirected back to
the application with error and error description parameters.
