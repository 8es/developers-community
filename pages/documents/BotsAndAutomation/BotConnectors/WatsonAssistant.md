### Overview

The following documentation outlines the configuration for the connector and how to implement functions specifically for **IBM Watson**.

### Bot Configuration

{: .important}
See the [Getting Started](bot-connectors-getting-started.html) guide first to complete pre-requisite steps.

With watson there are two ways of authentication that currently our system support, these are UserPass and IAM (token based) authentication. You can choose one of them for your bot configuration. 

#### UserPass authentication
You will be presented with following screen to complete the Vendor Settings in order to add bot connector using UserPass authentication.

#### Test Connection

{: .important}
You have to agree to Data Disclaimer from now onward in order to use the services of bot connector. For that you can click on the checkbox "I agree to the Data Disclaimer

For validation of the credentials provided, you can now perform a test connection request to see if everything that you have provided is working and reachable. You can click on the button "Test Connection" to see if connection succeed or fail. For UserPass authentication see in Figure 1.3 and 1.4. For IAM authentication see in Figure 1.5 and 1.6.

Following guide is going to present customization for the Watson Assistant on how to implement functions specifically for **IBM Watson**. It is intended for users who are familiar with IBM Watson cloud dashboard. Continue if you are familiar and have access to IBM Watson cloud dashboard.


### Sending Rich Content (Structured Content)

The core LiveEngage platform supports the use of rich/structured content. For more information on the format and functionality available, please refer to the documentation found [here](getting-started-with-rich-messaging-introduction.html). As a result, the Bot Connector also supports this.

To send structured content via Watson Assistant you will need send custom JSON. To do this, you will need to select the dialog node that will hold the structured content (Figure 2.1).


<img style="width:850px" src="img/watsonassistant/dialognode.png">

Figure 2.1 Watson Dialog Node


From there, under the section Then respond with: Click the three vertical dots and select Open JSON Editor (Figure 2.2)

<img style="width:500px" src="img/watsonassistant/dialogjsoneditor.png">

Figure 2.2 Watson Assistant Dialog JSON Editor


In the JSON Editor you will need to add your custom JSON response (Figure 2.3).

<img style="width:500px" src="img/watsonassistant/jsoneditor.png">

Figure 2.3 Watson Assistant JSON Editor


There is a strict JSON structure for the response that must be used. The JSON structure can be found below in **Figure 2.4** with a sample JSON example that uses a standard Structured Content card with a button option in **Figure 2.5**.

```json
{
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "values": [
        {
          "metadata": {
            "id": "1234",
            "type": "ExternalId"
          },
          "structuredContent": {}
        }
      ],
      "selection_policy": "sequential"
    }
  }
}
```

            "type": "ExternalId"
          },
          "structuredContent": {
            "type": "vertical",
            "elements": [
              {

                "click": {
                  "actions": [
                    {
                      "text": "Recommend me a movie, please",
                      "type": "publishText"
                    }
                  ]
                },
                "title": "Recommend a movie"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ],
      "selection_policy": "sequential"
    }
  }
}
```

For new IAM workspaces that have a new Watson response, *Then respond with* text:

<img style="width:400px" src="img/watsonassistant/image_5.png">

Put the structured content objects with the metadata in the text field for the response.

```json
{
  "output": {
    "generic": [
      {
        "values": [
          {
            "text": "{\n          \"metadata\": {\n            \"id\": \"1234\",\n            \"type\": \"ExternalId\"\n          },\n          \"structuredContent\": {\n            \"type\": \"vertical\",\n            \"elements\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"What kind of credit card are you interested in?\",\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"tooltip\": \"text tooltip\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"button\",\n                \"click\": {\n                  \"actions\": [\n                    {\n                      \"text\": \"Personal\",\n                      \"type\": \"publishText\"\n                    }\n                  ]\n                },\n                \"title\": \"Personal\",\n                \"tooltip\": \"button tooltip\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"button\",\n                \"click\": {\n                  \"actions\": [\n                    {\n                      \"text\": \"Business\",\n                      \"type\": \"publishText\"\n                    }\n                  ]\n                },\n                \"title\": \"Business\",\n                \"tooltip\": \"button tooltip\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"button\",\n                \"click\": {\n                  \"actions\": [\n                    {\n                      \"text\": \"Other\",\n                      \"type\": \"publishText\"\n                    }\n                  ]\n                },\n                \"title\": \"Other\",\n                \"tooltip\": \"button tooltip\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        }"
          }
        ],
        "response_type": "text",
        "selection_policy": "sequential"
      }
    ]
  }
}

### Change Time To Response of Conversation

Change the TTR of a conversation based on the action response of Watson. There have 4 different types. "URGENT", "NORMAL", "PRIORITIZED", "CUSTOM". Only the "CUSTOM" can set a value. The unit of the value is second. And the value of the others are defined in the Agent Workspace.

```json
{
    "output" : {
          "text" : {
                 "values" : [
                        "Sure thing! Change the TTR to 50 minutes."
                  ],
                  "selection_policy" : "sequential"
           },
          "actions" : [
                 {
                     "name" : "CHANGE_TTR",
                     "type" : "CLIENT",               
                     "parameters" : {
                        "ttrType" : "CUSTOM",
                        "value" : 3000  
                     },
                     "result_variable" : "none"
                 }   
           ]
     }
}
```

### Transfer/Escalations

<div class="notice">
<strong>Naming Conventions:</strong> Before going into <strong>actions</strong> and <strong>skills</strong> is the naming convention between each.

All non-escalation actions are defined by using underscores. For example, in the case of closing a conversation, the action name returned by <strong>Watson</strong> needs to be <strong>CLOSE_CONVERSATION</strong>. Further down the line, if any additional functionality is added that can be called by an action from the AI, it will follow the same naming convention.

For escalations, the naming convention for these skills should use a "-" instead of "_". Furthermore, if transferring to a skill, specifically assigned to bots, it’s best practice to prefix the skill name with "BOT-" within LiveEngage.

</div>

Transfers and escalations are straightforward in both chat and messaging. At the beginning of a chat session or when a messaging bot logs in, all the list of enabled skills on the account are retrieved, keyed by name and stored. When a transfer is requested by the bot, the skill name is matched to one already on the account and the id is retrieved and escalated to. In regards to **Watson Assistant**, this should be configured in the following way:

<img style="width:850px" src="img/watsonassistant/image_6.png">

In the *Then respond with:* JSON editor block, we see the following:

```json
{
  "output" : {
    "text" : {
      "values" : [
            "Sure thing! Escalating you to a live agent now."
      ],
      "selection_policy" : "sequential"
    },
    "actions" : [
      {
        "name" : "TRANSFER",
        "type" : "CLIENT",               
        "parameters" : {
          "skill" : "BOT-TRANSFER-OUT" // case sensitive, should be exactly the same as in LiveEngage
        },
        "result_variable" : "none"
      }   
    ]
  }
}
```
Figure 2.7 Watson JSON response for escalation


Above is the *actions* array. Here, we have a escalation skill name in the *skill* parameter. This is the name of our skill for escalation. This will be sent in the BOSO object to the chat/messaging connector, which will grab the skillId from an array based on the name, and escalate.

### Close Chat/Conversation

To close a chat or messaging conversation, we utilize the action object as we did for a transfer (see **Figure 2.6**). In **Figure 2.7** below, the **Watson Assistant** JSON response should be mirrored as follows:

```json
{
    "output" : {
          "text" : {
                 "values" : [
                        "Thank you for speaking with us today!"
                  ],
                  "selection_policy" : "sequential"
           },
          "actions" : [
                 {
                        "name" : "CLOSE_CONVERSATION",
                        "type" : "client",
                        "result_variable" : "none"
                 }
           ],
     }
}
```
