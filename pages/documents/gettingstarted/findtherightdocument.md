If you don't have a specific use case in mind, simply browse the site to find out more about our API capabilities and features. The LivePerson Developers site is comprised of the following sections:

* **Guides** - this section includes general guides to using our APIs and SDKs. These work across all of our APIs, except where otherwise mentioned. In this section you can find documents on topics like Authentication, how to retrieve API keys, using Engagement Attributes and more.

* **Consumer Experience** - this section includes documentation pertaining to features which impact, manipulate or influence the consumer experience (i.e. the interface with which a consumer starts an interaction with your brand). It includes useful documentation regarding our Mobile App Messaging SDK (used to integrate messaging right into your native application), the Messaging Window API (used to customize and create messaging windows) and the Connector API (used to build connector applications which integrate LiveEngage to  many third-party messaging platforms).

* **Agent Interactions** - this section includes documentation pertaining to agent behavior, workspace and features. Important documents include the Messaging Agent SDK (which enables bots as agents and handles sending messages to and from those bots), the Chat Agent API (which allows you to control how chat messages get sent to and from your agents) and the Agent Workspace Widget SDK (which allows you to create and integrate custom widgets into the LiveEngage agent workspace).

* **Data** - this section includes documentation pertaining to LivePerson's data storage, analysis and reporting capabilities. These documents allow you to poll LivePerson servers yourself, retrieving various data types yourselves for use in your own reporting tools. Main documents include the Data Access API (which allows you access to your account's data across all segments), the Messaging Operations API (which retrieves useful information at the contact center level, allowing agent managers to make their call centers more efficient) and the Engagement History API (which focuses on retrieving messaging interaction history and transcripts).

* **Real Time Interactions** - this section includes documentation pertaining to events which are fired or information that is passed during a conversation. These documents include the Engagement Window Widget SDK (which allows you to integrate third party web services to the engagement window, extending its functionality), the Engagement Attributes API (which allows you to pass and receive engagement attributes which provide further information on a visitor) and the Visit Information API (which allows you to retrieve information about the visitor in real time).

* **Account Configuration** - this section includes documentation pertaining to APIs which allow you to configure your LiveEngage account via REST calls. This allows you to perform bulk actions with greater ease on your account or configure it programmatically, according to rules which you determine. These documents include the Predefined Content API (which allows you to retrieve, create and compare predefined content on your account), the Automatic Messages API (which allows you to retrieve, create and compare automatic messages on your account) and the Agent Status Reason API (which allows you to retrieve, create and compare status reasons on your account).

* **Admin** - this section includes documentation pertaining to APIs which allow you to configure various administration features on your account, such as creating new skills, agent groups and more. Much like the Account Configuration documents, this allows you to perform bulk actions with greater ease on your account or configure it programmatically, according to rules which you determine. These documents include the Skills API (which allows you to retrieve, create and compare skills on your account), the Users API (which allows you to retrieve, create and compare users on your account) and the Profiles API (which allows you to retrieve, create and compare profiles on your account).
