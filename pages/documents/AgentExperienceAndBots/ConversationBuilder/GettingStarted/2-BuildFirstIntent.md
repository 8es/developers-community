In the Hello World bot/automation tutorial, you used Patterns to match on User Says input of `goodbye`, `bye`, etc. 

Using the Patterns field in the Interaction Settings menu is a quick and simple way to get a dialog set up. However, when you start to build multiple bots/automations and multiple dialogs, it becomes more convenient to make common patterns re-usable.

Creating an Intent allows for a more robust and re-usable way to match on User Says input.

Go back to the welcome screen of the Conversation Builder by clicking on the Home button in the Settings Toolbar. Then click either the top-left or the dropdown and go to Intent Builder.

Create a new Intent Builder domain called Hello World. This domain will hold all of your Intents for these tutorials.
