The Assist tool is a helper tool which "listens" to your dialog as you build it, interaction by interaction, and suggests intents, entities, patterns, and more which can be added to each interaction.

### Adding a Domain

When you create your first interaction, the Assist helper tool will automatically pop up on the right hand side of the Conversation Builder. You'll be prompted to add a domain from the list of domains you have set up (to learn more about setting up domains, please see [this link](conversation-builder-component-breakdown-intent-builder-overview.html)). If you have not configured a domain yet, you will not be prompted to add one.

Select one of your domains from the list and click on it. From then on, for this dialog, Assist will recommend using intents and entities from this domain, identifying areas where they might be relevant using NLU (in essence, it recognizes keywords that you use in an interaction *and* an intent or entity, offering you to link between the two).
