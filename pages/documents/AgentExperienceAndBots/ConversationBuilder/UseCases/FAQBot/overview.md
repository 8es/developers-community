This guide will help step you through setting up a Knowledge Base (KB), and an FAQ Bot. This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the basic concepts and components of the Conversation Builder Platform. If you're not, we advise that you get started with some of our [more basic tutorials](conversation-builder-getting-started-hello-conversation-builder.html) or [documents](conversation-builder-overview-component-breakdown.html), which will introduce you to the platform in a more friendly way.
