### FAQS

**What should we do if our Infrastructure team does not allow Websocket based integrations into LiveEngage?**

Connectors deployed using BotCentral platform are Http Proxy connectors, which can be used in this case.

**How do I get started?**

Contact your client partner and they will initiate the process with the Technical Services team.
