### Overview

The following documentation outlines the pre-requirements to use the Bot Platform specifically for **IBM Watson Assistant**.

### Base Requirements

#### LiveEngage Configuration

##### Bot User Account Configuration

Outlined below is the steps required to create an appropriate Bot Type agent in LiveEngage.
The result of which is fed into the "Bot Configuration" Below.

Create User type “bot” with a role of Agent

1. Add a new user in LiveEngage, choose "Bot" for “User type”. If “User type” is not available, relevant AC feature needs to be turned on.	

  <img style="width:600px" src="img/watsonassistant/image_0.png">

1. Add login method as "API key" and generate new API key for the new user

  <img style="width:600px" src="img/watsonassistant/image_1.png">

1. Make sure the user has chat and/or messaging slot > 0 based on the target channel of the bot.

2. Add other required APIs to the bot api key:

    1. Find api key name in bot user profile

**Below is Messaging ONLY!!!**

    2. Go to API management page (campaign list > data source) and add following APIs to the bot’s API key:

        1. Data API

        2. Administration API

#### Naming Conventions

One thing to note before going into *actions* and *skills* is the naming convention between each. 

All non-escalation actions are defined by using underscores. For example, in the case of closing a conversation, the action name returned by **Watson** needs to be *CLOSE_CONVERSATION*. Further down the line, if any additional functionality is added that can be called by an action from the AI, it will follow the same naming convention.

For escalations, the naming convention for these skills should use a "-" instead of “_”. Furthermore, if transferring to a skill, specifically assigned to bots, it’s best practice to prefix the skill name with “BOT-” within LiveEngage.

### IBM Watson Assistant

#### Functions of the Bot Platform 

The Bot Platform provides the base functionality to send and receive text messages between LiveEngage and Watson Assistant. The integration between the Bot Platform and Watson Assistant also supports the sending [structured content](https://developers.liveperson.com/structured-content-templates.html###overview). The Bot Platform also provides further functionality such as the ability to transfer the conversation to other skills, changing the TTR of a conversation as well as the ability close a conversation. These actions are sent in the action array of Watson Assistant’s JSON response.

The following provides a detailed look at how to implement the supported functionality.

#### Sending Rich Content (Structured Content)

The core LiveEngage platform supports the use of rich/structured content. For more information on the format and functionality available, please refer to the documentation found [here](https://developers.liveperson.com/structured-content-introduction-to-structured-content.html). As a result, the Bot Platform also supports this.

To send structured content via Watson Assistant you will need send custom JSON. To do this, you will need to select the dialog node that will hold the structured content (Figure 2.1).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 2.1 Watson Dialog Node</td>
  </tr>
</table>


From there, under the section **Then respond with: **Click the three vertical dots and select **Open JSON Editor **(Figure 2.2)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 2.2 Watson Assistant Dialog JSON Editor</td>
  </tr>
</table>


In the JSON Editor you will need to add your custom JSON response (Figure 2.3).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 2.3 Watson Assistant JSON Editor</td>
  </tr>
</table>


There is a strict JSON structure for the response that must be used. The JSON structure can be found below in **Figure 2.4** with a sample JSON example that uses a standard Structured Content card with a button option in **Figure 2.5**.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>{
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "values": [
        {
          "metadata": {
            "id": "1234",
            "type": "ExternalId"
          },
          "structuredContent": {}
        }
      ],
      "selection_policy": "sequential"
    }
  }
}
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 2.4 Structured Content Watson JSON Structure</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>{
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "values": [
        {
          "metadata": {
            "id": "1234",
            "type": "ExternalId"
          },
          "structuredContent": {
            "type": "vertical",
            "elements": [
              {
                "type": "button",
                "click": {
                  "actions": [
                    {
                      "text": "Recommend me a movie, please",
                      "type": "publishText"
                    }
                  ]
                },
                "title": "Recommend a movie"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ],
      "selection_policy": "sequential"
    }
  }
}

</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 2.4 Structured Content Watson JSON Example</td>
  </tr>
</table>


For new IAM workspaces that have a new Watson response, *Then respond with* text:

<img style="width:600px" src="img/watsonassistant/image_5.png">

Put the structured content objects with the metadata in the text field for the response.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>{
  "output": {
    "generic": [
      {
        "values": [
          {
            "text": "{\n          \"metadata\": {\n            \"id\": \"1234\",\n            \"type\": \"ExternalId\"\n          },\n          \"structuredContent\": {\n            \"type\": \"vertical\",\n            \"elements\": [\n              {\n                \"text\": \"What kind of credit card are you interested in?\",\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"tooltip\": \"text tooltip\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"button\",\n                \"click\": {\n                  \"actions\": [\n                    {\n                      \"text\": \"Personal\",\n                      \"type\": \"publishText\"\n                    }\n                  ]\n                },\n                \"title\": \"Personal\",\n                \"tooltip\": \"button tooltip\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"button\",\n                \"click\": {\n                  \"actions\": [\n                    {\n                      \"text\": \"Business\",\n                      \"type\": \"publishText\"\n                    }\n                  ]\n                },\n                \"title\": \"Business\",\n                \"tooltip\": \"button tooltip\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"button\",\n                \"click\": {\n                  \"actions\": [\n                    {\n                      \"text\": \"Other\",\n                      \"type\": \"publishText\"\n                    }\n                  ]\n                },\n                \"title\": \"Other\",\n                \"tooltip\": \"button tooltip\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        }"
          }
        ],
        "response_type": "text",
        "selection_policy": "sequential"
      }
    ]
  }
}

  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>


#### Change Time To Response of Conversation

Change the TTR of a conversation based on the action response of Watson. There have 4 different types. "URGENT", “NORMAL”, “PRIORITIZED”, “CUSTOM”. Only the “CUSTOM” can set a value. The unit of the value is second. And the value of the others are defined in the Agent Workspace. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>{
    "output" : {
          “text” : {
                 “values” : [
                        “Sure thing! Change the TTR to 50 minutes.”
                  ],
                  “selection_policy” : “sequential”
           },
          “actions” : [
                 {
                     “name” : “CHANGE_TTR”,
                     “type” : “CLIENT”,               
                     “parameters” : {
                        “ttrType” : “CUSTOM”,
                        “value” : 3000  
                     },
                     “result_variable” : “none”
                 }   
           ]
     }
}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 2.6 Watson JSON response for changing TTR</td>
  </tr>
</table>


#### Transfer/Escalations

Transfers and escalations are straightforward in both chat and messaging. At the beginning of a chat session or when a messaging bot logs in, all the list of enabled skills on the account are retrieved, keyed by name and stored. When a transfer is requested by the bot, the skill name is matched to one already on the account and the id is retrieved and escalated to. In regards to **Watson Assistant**, this should be configured in the following way:

<img style="width:600px" src="img/watsonassistant/image_6.png">

In the *Then respond with: *JSON editor block, we see the following:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>{
    "output" : {
          “text” : {
                 “values” : [
                        “Sure thing! Escalating you to a live agent now.”
                  ],
                  “selection_policy” : “sequential”
           },
          “actions” : [
                 {
                     “name” : “TRANSFER”,
                     “type” : “CLIENT”,               
                     “parameters” : {
                        “skill” : “BOT-TRANSFER-OUT”
                     },
                     “result_variable” : “none”
                 }   
           ]
     }
}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 2.7 Watson JSON response for escalation</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Above is the *actions *array. Here, we have a escalation skill name in the *skill* parameter. This is the name of our skill for escalation. This will be sent in the BOSO object to the chat/messaging connector, which will grab the skillId from an array based on the name, and escalate.

#### Close Chat/Conversation

To close a chat or messaging conversation, we utilize the action object as we did for a transfer (see **Figure 2.6**). In **Figure 2.7** below, the **Watson Assistant** JSON response should be mirrored as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>{
    "output" : {
          “text” : {
                 “values” : [
                        “Thank you for speaking with us today!”
                  ],
                  “selection_policy” : “sequential”
           },
          “actions” : [
                 {
                        “name” : “CLOSE_CONVERSATION”,
                        “type” : “client”,
                        “result_variable” : “none”
                 }
           ],
     }
}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 2.8 Watson Assistant JSON response for closing chat/conversation</td>
  </tr>
</table>
