### Introduction

External Bot frameworks and Bot builders can be enabled and managed through LiveEngage just like a normal human agent.

Using the Bot Connector Manager, you can provision a bot connector for IBM Watson, Google Dialog Flow, Amazon Lex, etc.

There are two steps to setting up a new bot connector. 

1. Set up Bot user in LiveEngage

2. Provision connector in the Bot Connector Management dashboard

Outlined below will be step 1. 

The result of this is fed into the "Bot Configuration" outlined in each product specific guide.

### Set Up Bot User in LiveEngage

1. Add a new user in LiveEngage, choose "Bot" for “User type”. If “User type” is not available, contact your LivePerson account manager to enable the feature.
