### Introduction

External Bot frameworks and Bot builders can be enabled and managed through LiveEngage just like a normal human agent.

Using the Bot Connector dashboard, you can provision a bot connector for IBM Watson, Google Dialog Flow, and more.

{: .important}
If you need to connect a external bot that does not have a pre-built connector, see [this document](bot-connectors-custom-third-party-bots.html) for instructions.

Each connector provides the functionality to

* send/receive text messages

* send [structured content](getting-started-with-rich-messaging-introduction.html)

* transfer the conversation to other skills

* change Time To Response for a messaging conversation

* close a conversation

Some connectors may provide more or less functionality depending on the specifics of the product to which it is connecting.

There are two steps to setting up a new bot connector.

1. Create Bot user in LiveEngage

2. Provision connector in the Bot Connector dashboard

### Create Bot User in LiveEngage

1. Add a new user in LiveEngage, choose "Bot" for “User type”. If “User type” is not available, contact your LivePerson account manager to enable the feature.

2. Add login method as "API key" and generate new API key for the new user

3. Make sure the user has chat and/or messaging slot > 0 based on the target channel of the bot.

4. Set Max No of Live Chats

    * If Chat in the drop down select  - Value > 1.

    * If Messaging Max No of Live Chats -> **No Chats and Max No of Messaging Converversations to Custom Setting and enter a value greater than 0**

5. Find api key name in bot user profile
