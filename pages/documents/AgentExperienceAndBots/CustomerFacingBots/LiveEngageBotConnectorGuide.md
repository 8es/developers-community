### Introduction

The LiveEngage platform helps orchestrate the flow of messages back and forth between consumers and Agents. Consumers can be on any end-user channel such as SMS, Web, Facebook Messenger and Apple Business chat, to communicate with both Human and

Automated (Bot) agents. This guide helps you with steps required to enable bots in the LiveEngage platform.  

A bot is an automated conversational agent that performs a specific goal. Enterprise customers can build and deploy bots using different frameworks and products and then enable them through LiveEngage.

* Customers can also use external Bot frameworks and Bot builders to build bots.  Some of these products include IBM Watson, Microsoft Bot framework, Google Dialog Flow, Amazon Lex or any other niche bot platforms customers want to use to build bots.

* BotCentral Platform (Owned by Liveperson)

* Conversation Builder, a LivePerson product (in Beta) , allows customers to build and deploy bots directly within LiveEngage.

This document is for internal users to educate bot builders working on behalf of the customers who want to deploy bots in LiveEngage. Deploying bots in LiveEngage enables all the messages to go through LiveEngage Hub and will be routed to the bots based on the skills assigned to the bots.

This document covers the following different scenarios with regards to deploying bots in LiveEngage. Customers have built bot using one of the following platforms / frameworks

1. IBM Watson

    1. Watson Assistant

    2. Watson Conversation

2. Google Dialog Flow 1.0

3. Google Dialog Flow 2.0 (available mid december 2018)

4. Microsoft Bot Framework (LUIS)

5. Amazon Lex

6. Liveperson Bots & Automation Platform (aka BotCentral owned by Liveperson)

7. Any Bot Platform (small, medium)

8. LivePerson Conversation Builder (new in alpha, will be GA in Jan 2019)

## FAQS

**What should we do if our Infrastructure team does not allow Websocket based integration into LiveEngage?**

Connectors deployed using BotCentral platform are Http Proxy connectors, which can be used in this case.

**How do I get started?**

Contact your client partner and they will initiate the process with the Technical Services team.
