### Introduction

Profiles within LiveEngage can be Admin, Agent Manager, Agent, Campaign Manager or customized profile. The profile entity includes name, description, role and permissions. This API allows you to manipulate such profiles, by creating new ones, updating them or simply retrieving information on which profiles are available and their metadata.
