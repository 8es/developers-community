To give brands the option to call their FaaS functions from outside of LivePerson's platform, we provide an API for External Invocation. With this API they can call their functions externally, secured by OAuth2.

Further information about OAuth2 and how we use it:

* OAuth2 introduction video: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPbvxxslDTU)

* Official Liveperson OAuth2 flow documentation: [link](authorizing-liveengage-applications-overview.html)

### Prerequisites for using external invocations:

* Execute the **App Installation** process in order to generate a `client-id` and `client_secret` for the oAuth2.0 flow. This can be done by your LivePerson account team, so you should contact them for more assistance (you can also see [this](https://developers.liveperson.com/guides-le-applications-installing.html) guide for more detailed information).

Once you have secured your `client-id` and `client-secret`, and depending on your account, you can use the following hosts for external invocations (the base domain is: `faasGW`):

* **APAC**: [sy.faasgw.liveperson.net](http://sy.faasgw.liveperson.net/)

* **EMEA**: [lo.faasgw.liveperson.net](http://lo.faasgw.liveperson.net/)

* **US**: [va.faasgw.liveperson.net](http://va.faasgw.liveperson.net/)

However, instead of hardcoding the domain, it is recommended to use the [LivePerson Domain API](https://developers.liveperson.com/agent-domain-domain-api.html) to retrieve this information by providing the service name `faasGW` and retrieving the domain **dynamically**.

### Step 1: Retrieve the domain of the oAuth server.

You'll also need to pass your `client-id` and `client-secret` to one of our oAuth servers for authentication. Depending on your account, you can use the following oAuth servers (the base domain is: `sentinel`):

* **APAC:** sy.sentinel.liveperson.net

* **EMEA:** lo.sentinel.liveperson.net

* **US:** va.sentinel.liveperson.net

However, instead of hardcoding the oAuth server, it is recommended to use the [LivePerson Domain API](https://developers.liveperson.com/agent-domain-domain-api.html) to retrieve this information by providing the service name `sentinel` and retrieving the host address **dynamically**.

### Step 2: Get the **lambda UUID** from FaaS

Before starting this step, you will need an **oauth2 token** generated by this user before the FaaS lambda invocation (refer to [this](https://developers.liveperson.com/authorizing-liveengage-applications-overview.html) guide for more information on how to generate this token).

Please note that an access token is valid for 8 hours only. Its validity can be extended by calling a refresh endpoint. In order to refresh an existing access token, the application should use a refresh request as mentioned [here](https://developers.liveperson.com/authorizing-liveengage-applications-methods-refresh-request.html). It is recommended that the refresh request be made every 30 minutes to ensure that the access token does not expire.

Here is an example-app for executing the OAuth 2 flow: [link](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/sample-app-authorization). If you use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) you can use this template to retrieve your token ([Postman Collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LivePersonInc/developers-community/master/assets/FaaS.postman_collection.json)).

Once you have your token and your `client-id` and `client-secret`, you can input them into the FaaS UI to retrieve your `lambda UUID`:

1. In your request-tab under your function click on **Authorization**

2. Select type oAuth 2.0

3. Click on **Get New Access Token**

4. In the appearing dialog fill out the form:

    1. **Token Name**: how you want this token to be named

    2. **Grant Type**: **Authorization Code**

    3. **Callback URL**: the redirect-uri you set during [App Installation](https://developers.liveperson.com/guides-le-applications-installing.html)

    4. **Auth URL**: the relevant LivePerson oAuth host for your account (see above for more information). For example: https://va-a.sentinel.liveperson.net/sentinel/api/account/2065377/authorize?v=1.0

    5. **Access Token URL**: https://va-a.sentinel.liveperson.net/sentinel/api/account/2065377/token?v=2.0

    6. **Client ID**: the generated `client_id` you received from the [App Installation](https://developers.liveperson.com/guides-le-applications-installing.html) (provided by your LivePerson account team)

    7. **Client Secret**: the generated `client_secret` you received from the [App Installation](https://developers.liveperson.com/guides-le-applications-installing.html) (provided by your LivePerson account team)

    8. **Client Authentication**: **Send client credentials in Body**

5. Click on **Request Token** to send the request and retrieve your token.

6. Now the oAuth2.0 flow is triggered and you will first be forwarded to the LiveEngage login page. There you need to provide the credentials of the system-user that will be used for invocation.

7. On the following screen you can see your generated **Access Token**. You'll use this token to perform the invocation. The access-token will be sent with every FaaS invocation.

8. Below is also the **refresh_token** you need for refreshing your Access Token

9. If you click **Use Token**, the Access Token will be used for your Postman call

### Step 3: Calling the invocation API

First, check that all prerequisites have been performed and you have all the following information:

    * **AccountId** is available.

    * **LambdaUUID** is available.

    * **UserId** is available of the system-user invoking FaaS.

    * **Username + password** of the system-user invoking FaaS.

    * **Client-Id + Client-Secret** is available after App-Installation.

    * **Callback-URL** of oAuth flow is available and accessible.

    * **Sentinel + FaaS - domain** is available.

To show how the invocation API can be called, we will use the same Postman collection which was linked above. This collection **first** uses the oAuth2.0 flow to retrieve a valid **access-token,** and **second** executes the FaaS **invocation**, providing the retrieved access-token within the headers.

**Please Note** that the system-user that is created for invocation purposes is a dedicated user for this purpose and is not an active user on the account. Also make sure that the permissions for this user are configured to **FaaS Invoker**.

#### Following the example

1. Download the [Postman Collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LivePersonInc/developers-community/master/assets/FaaS.postman_collection.json)

2. Import the collection into your local Postman

This collection contains one POST-request. The main call within this collection is to our invocation endpoint and has the following structure:

`https://{faasGW_domain}/api/account/{accountId}/lambdas/{lambdaUUID}/invoke?v=1&userId={userId}`

Parameters of the URL:

* **faasGW_domain**: domain used for FaaS invocation

* **accountId**: your accountId

* **lambdaUUID**: uuid for the lambda

* **userId**: user-Id for the user that created the Oauth2 token

The body is as follows (content type: application/json):

```json
{
	"timestamp": 0,
	"headers": [
		{
			"key": "string",
			"value": "string"
		}
	],
	"payload": {}
}
```

The body is similar to the values sent via the FaaS invocation UI. Additionally, each invocation needs to provide a timestamp in unix-epoch time format.

However, before the main call can be executed we need to retrieve the access-token. This is done via the oAuth host. Therefore, some additional configuration needs to be done in Postman to comply with the authorization process detailed above. **Please follow Step 2 above and provide the necessary details listed there to the Postman collection**.

As before, please refer to [this](https://developers.liveperson.com/authorizing-liveengage-applications-overview.html) guide for deeper insights about how the oAuth host and its APIs work.

3. Once you have retrieved the access token, add it to your call. Now the main call can be executed with the retrieved access-token.

4. Invoking the function in Postman:

    * Fill out the required Post-body

    * Press **Send**

    * As a response you should see the result of your `lambda`
