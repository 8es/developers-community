### Overview

LiveEngage provides a way for developers and partners that are building an agent bot using the Messaging Agent SDK to pass metadata or context information on a conversation. For example, consumer identified intents, transfer / escalation reason and an identifier to message content (e.g., structure content or plain text).

**Note: currently, sending metadata is useful over Messaging only. Sending metadata over Chat is supported but we are currently developing the consumption of the metadata on Chat conversations. If you would still like to send metadata over Chat conversations and consume it in the future once that is supported, please see [the following example below](#sending-metadata-over-chat)**.

The information can be used to achieve the following:

* Empower messaging agents with relevant information during messaging conversations with consumers.

* Analyze the messaging conversation, the bot and the content that was presented to the consumer.


To get started, refer to the [Messaging Agent SDK](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-agent-sdk-overview.html) documentation.

### Available metadata

There are 3 types of available metadata:

* Bot response

* Action reason

* Structured / Rich content identifier

#### Bot response

Bot response metadata is context information / the bot analysis of the last consumer message. This information can be used to help Agent Managers monitor a conversation with a bot as well as analyze the bot performance.

**Type**: BotResponse

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|----------|-----------|----|
|externalConversationId|External platform conversation identifier|String(maxLength=64)|
|businessCases|The topics / business cases of the conversation. In Watson Virtual Agent, this data is stored in the capability field | Array &lt;String(maxLength=256)&gt;|
|intents|List of intents identified for a consumer message|Array<Intent>|

**Intent**

<table>
  <thead>
   <tr>
   <th>Name</th>
   <th>Description</th>
   <th>Type/Value</th>
   <th>Required</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
     <td>id</td>
     <td>Intent id.</td>
     <td>String (maxLength = 256)</td>
     <td>Yes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>name</td>
     <td>Intent name.</td>
     <td>String (maxLength = 256)</td>
     <td>No</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>confidenceScore</td>
     <td>Intent confidence level value as calculated by the integrated platform.</td>
     <td>Number (between 0 and 1)</td>
     <td>Yes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>confidence</td>
     <td>Normalized intent confidence level (low, medium, high).</td>
     <td>String (maxLength = 64)</td>
     <td>No</td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


#### Action reason

Action reason metadata describes the reason behind an action that was taken by a bot or a human agent, such as escalation or transfer. This information can be used to both provide information to an agent receiving a conversation that was escalated by a bot as well as analyze the transfer and escalation rate per escalation reason.

**Type**: ActionReason

<table>
  <thead>
   <tr>
     <th>Name</th>
     <th>Description</th>
     <th>Type/Value</th>
     <th>Required</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
     <td>reasonId</td>
     <td>The reason id.</td>
     <td>String (maxLength = 64)</td>
     <td>No</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>reason</td>
     <td>The reason description.</td>
     <td>String (maxLength = 64) Suggested values<br>'escalated_by_user'<br>'escalated_by_bot'<br>'escalated_by_configuration'<br>'escalated_by_error'</td>
     <td>Yes</td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


#### Escalation summary

Escalation summary metadata is a summary of conversation information up to an escalation event, it includes conversation duration, escalation reason and identified businessCases. This information is used in messaging for the Bot escalation widget in the agent workspace.

**Type**: EscalationSummary

<table>
  <thead>
   <tr>
     <th>Name</th>
     <th>Description</th>
     <th>Type/Value</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
     <td>escalationCause</td>
     <td>Escalation reason</td>
     <td>String (maxLength = 64) Suggested values:<br>'escalated_by_user'<br>'escalated_by_bot'<br>'escalated_by_configuration'<br>'escalated_by_error'</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>businessCases</td>
     <td>The list of topics / business cases identified during the conversation and respective time</td>
     <td>Array &lt;BusinessCase&gt;</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>conversationDuration</td>
     <td>The conversation duration</td>
     <td>integer</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>escalatedDuringBusinessCase</td>
     <td>The topic / business case that led to the escalation </td>
     <td>String (maxLength = 256)</td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


**businessCase**

<table>
  <thead>
   <tr>
     <th>Name</th>
     <th>Description</th>
     <th>Type/Value</th>
     <th>Required</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
     <td>id</td>
     <td>BusinessCase name</td>
     <td>String (maxLength = 256)</td>
     <td>No</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>time</td>
     <td>The duration in the conversation this businessCase was handled</td>
     <td>integer</td>
     <td>No</td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


#### Structured content identifier (ExternalId)

Structured content identifier metadata is used to both identify a specific "Card" (Structured Content) as well as a specific action on a “Card”. This can be used to measure the number of times a specific Card was sent, delivered, viewed and the number of times a specific action was clicked / selected.

**Type**: ExternalId

<table>
  <thead>
   <tr>
     <th>Name</th>
     <th>Description</th>
     <th>Type/Value</th>
     <th>Required</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
     <td>id</td>
     <td>The "Card" / “Card” action identifier</td>
     <td>String (maxLength = 64)</td>
     <td>Yes</td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


### Use cases and code sample

#### Bot as an agent

A bot as an agent manages conversations with consumers, analyzes their intent based on their input, assists them or transfers them to a human agent.

The bot consumer input analysis information can be passed as metadata on the bot response (publishEvent/[Add line](https://developers.liveperson.com/agent-add-lines.html) method). This be used as a useful to analyze the bot performance and help Agent Managers to monitor the conversation flow.

The reason for escalation as well as the last identified intent can be sent as metadata on the transfer action (updateConversationField method), currently supported only in messaging; this information can be useful to analyze the bot performance, help Agent Managers to monitor the conversation flow and provide context to human agents once a conversation was handed off.

**publishEvent example:**

```javascript
const metadata = [
   {
       type: 'ActionReason',
       reason: 'escalated_by_bot', // The reason for escalation, can be other reason
       reasonId: '3'
   },
   {
       type: 'BotResponse', // Bot context information about the last consumer message
       externalConversationId: 'conversation_id',
       businessCases: [
           'Help-Greetings' // identified capability
       ],
       intents: [ // Last consumer message identified intents
           {
               id: 'Help-Greetings',
               confidenceScore: 1,
               confidence: 'high'
           },
           {
               id: 'Payment-Bank_Information',
               confidenceScore: 0.0,
               confidence: 'low'
           }
       ]
   }
];

// Send message
agent.publishEvent({
   dialogId: "THE CONVERSATION ID",
   event: {
       type: 'ContentEvent',
       contentType: 'text/plain',
       message: 'I am looking forward to helping you today.'
   }
}, null, metadata, (err, res) => {
   // Handle callback
});
```

**Bot escalation example:**

```javascript
const metadata = [
   {
       type: 'ActionReason',
       reason: 'escalated_by_bot', // The reason for escalation, can be other reason
       reasonId: '3'
   },
   {
       type: 'EscalationSummary',   // This is used for the escalation widget in the agent workspace
       escalationCause: 'escalated_by_bot', // The reason for escalation, can be other reason
       businessCases: [                      //all identified capabilities during the conversation
           {
               id: 'Help-Greetings',
               time: 9
           },  
           {
               id: 'Payment-Bank_Information',
               time: 13
           }        
       ],
       conversationDuration: 22,   //conversation duration up to the escalation
       escalatedDuringBusinessCase: 'Payment-Bank_Information' //the capability that led to escalation
   },
   {
       type: 'BotResponse',   //bot context information about the last consumer message
       externalConversationId: 'conversation_id',
       businessCases: [
           'Payment-Bank_Information'   //identified capability
       ],
       intents: [   //last consumer message identified intents
           {
               id: 'Payment-Bank_Information',
               confidence: '0.8'
           },
           {
               id: 'Help-Connect_to_Agent',
               confidence: '1'
           }
       ]
   }
];

//Escalate conversation
agent.updateConversationField({
   conversationId: "THE CONVERSATION ID",
   conversationField: [
       {
           field: "ParticipantsChange",
           type: "REMOVE",
           role: "ASSIGNED_AGENT"
       },
       {
           field: "Skill",
           type: "UPDATE",
           skill: "TARGET SKILL ID"
       }
   ]
}, null, metadata, (err, res) => {
});
```

### Structured content

[Structured Content Templates](https://developers.liveperson.com/structured-content-templates.html)

LiveEngage allows brands to send messages in a variety of ways and formats: (human or bot) agents can send simple text and images, or use structured content templates to build layouts with text, images, maps and buttons, to enhance the conversation with the consumer.  Refer to [Structured content templates](structured-content-templates-card.html) for more information on how to build and send such structured content messages.

A card identifier can be sent as metadata on the agent message (publishEvent method), in order to track the number of times a specific card was sent, delivered, or viewed.

An identifier to each action in a card can be embedded within the card JSON, in order to track the number of times a specific action was clicked / selected.  

**Messaging Structured content example:**
