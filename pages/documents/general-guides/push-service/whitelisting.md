### IP Whitelisting

To ensure that your communications infrastructure doesnâ€™t block communication from the LiveEngage push service, you'll need to whitelist the LivePerson IP ranges.

The complete list of IP ranges can be found [here](https://liveengage.liveperson.net/a/new/?connectionOpenArticle=configuring-your-firewall){:target="_blank"}.

**_Note: the LiveEngage push service works over standard port 443. Make sure that you enable connections to this port_**.
