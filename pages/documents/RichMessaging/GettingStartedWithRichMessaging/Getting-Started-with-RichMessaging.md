The majority of messages in a conversation are plain text like you are reading now. However, LivePerson provides many ways to enhance these messages with various interactive and styled messages.

Rich Messaging consists of add-ons to an _existing_ channel that allows you to push something more rich than just plain text.

The documents within Rich Messaging are organized by feature type. Within each feature dropdown, you will find the templates for each channel.

For a list of capabilities for each channel, see the Rich Messaging section of the [Messaging Channels Capabilities Comparison](messaging-channels-capabilities-comparison.html).
