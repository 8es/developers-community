The LiveEngage Mobile SDK and Web Messaging channels now support sending structured content elements via a set of templates. When agents or bots on LiveEngage share structured content layouts, consumers will view the rendered content

See the [Structured Content Overview](structured-content-overview.html) for more general information on how Structured Content works.

Developers will configure a JSON structured content schema and send the schema to the consumer via [LiveEngage Agent Widgets](https://developers.liveperson.com/agent-workspace-sdk-overview.html) (for human agent use cases) or via the [Messaging Agent SDK](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-agent-sdk-overview.html) (for bot use cases). The LivePerson Messaging Gateway then handles the transferring of the structured content JSON to the Facebook Messenger template payload which is rendered on the device and received by the consumer.  

The structured content templates explained and outlined in this document include [generic, button, list, carousel](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/templates) and [quick replies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/quick-replies).
