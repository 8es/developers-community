### Overview 

With Google RCS Business Messaging, brands can communicate with consumers through Android Messages, Googleâ€™s native messaging app. RCS Business Messaging has a range of rich media and rich messaging capabilities, providing an enhanced messaging experience.


The Google RCS messaging connector now support sending structured content elements via a set of templates that are rendered by Google. When agents or bots on LiveEngage share structured content templates, consumers will view the rendered templates via the Android Messages app.

See the [Structured Content Overview](structured-content-overview.html) for more information.

Developers will configure a JSON structured content schema and send the schema to the consumer via [LiveEngage Agent Widgets](https://developers.liveperson.com/agent-workspace-sdk-overview.html) (for human agent use cases) or via the [Messaging Agent SDK](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-agent-sdk-overview.html) (for bot use cases). The LivePerson Messaging Gateway then handles the transferring of the structured content JSON to the Google RCS template payload which is rendered on the device and received by the consumer.  

The structured content templates explained and outlined in this document include [generic, button, list, carousel](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/templates) and [quick replies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/quick-replies). 

To learn more about the LivePerson structured content framework, please review [the developer community guide](https://developers.liveperson.com/structured-content-templates.html).
