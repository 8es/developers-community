### Introduction

The LiveEngage Messaging Window API includes a file sharing feature. This feature enables consumers to share files with agents, such as images. This feature is enabled as part of the Messaging Window API.

<div class="important">The below tutorials assume that you have performed the initial steps required in order to work with this API, which can be found <a href="/messaging-window-api-getting-started.html">here</a>.</div>

File Sharing can also be enabled by using the Connector API, for cases when images are sent through third party applications. Please refer to the [Connector API documentation](/share-image-example.html) for more information on how to do this.

A typical flow of setting up the file sharing feature using the Messaging Window API:

1. [Enable file sharing capability](rich-messaging-file-sharing-1.html)

2. [Create a conversation](rich-messaging-file-sharing-2.html)

3. [Request an upload URL](rich-messaging-file-sharing-3.html)

4. [Upload the file to storage](rich-messaging-file-sharing-4.html)

5. [Publish the file as a message inside the conversation](rich-messaging-file-sharing-5.html)

6. [Request a download URL](rich-messaging-file-sharing-6.html)

7. [Download file from storage](rich-messaging-file-sharing-7.html)

We will examine and explain each stage in detail as part of this documentation.

**Note:** If you would like to follow the steps using `bash`, please see the [Prerequisites document](consumer-int-get-msg.html#prerequisites).
