# Getting Started with the Server Chat API

In order to use the Server Chat API, please follow the steps below:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html){:target="_blank"} to retrieve this information. With the service name =conversationVep

# RSS section - new

I'm adding this section again to see if it pops up in a notification on Feedly. Hoping this shows up on Feedly and posts on Slack. Writing some more just for volume's sake.

Trying again with RSS, hopefully this is the last time. Adding a line to push so that the feed sees new content and updates me. That's what I'm looking for.
