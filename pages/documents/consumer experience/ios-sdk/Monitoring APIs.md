### Introduction
Campaigns are the cornerstone of LiveEngage - the place where every digital engagement is created and organized.
By using campaigns, brands can target specific audiences in order to achieve their business goals, such as increasing sales or generating leads.

Using the Monitoring APIs, brands can:

* Report on the customerâ€™s journey inside the app

* Get engagements based on the reported SDEs

* Route conversations to a specific skill (based on engagements)

While web messaging allows automatic capturing of events (using the LE Tag), when using campaigns for In-App Messaging, it is up to the app to report the various events by using the In-App Monitoring APIs as will be explained in this guide.

### Monitoring APIs

The Monitoring APIs provide brands access to the LivePerson monitoring system. The APIs can be used for reporting on engagement attributes and to retrieve an engagement. The eligibility of an engagement is based on campaigns and an engagement's definitions.

Monitoring APIs include two APIs:

* [sendSDE](https://developers.liveperson.com/consumer-experience-ios-sdk-monitoring-methods.html) - Sends engagement attributes to LivePerson. Should be used whenever the app would like to report on an engagement attribute.

* [getEngagement](https://developers.liveperson.com/consumer-experience-ios-sdk-monitoring-methods.html) - In case that there is a matching campaign and engagement, getEngagement will return an engagement. The method can be used to send engagement attributes (as part of the request body) as well.

#### Code Samples

```swift
// 1. Init SDK with Monitoring
let monitoringInitParams = LPMonitoringInitParams(appInstallID: "appInstallID")
do {
    try LPMessagingSDK.instance.initialize("accountNumber", monitoringInitParams: monitoringInitParams)
} catch let error as NSError {
    print("initialize error: \(error)")
    return
}

// 2. APIs
let entryPoints = ["http://www.liveperson-test.com",
                   "sec://Food",
                   "lang://De"]
let engagementAttributes = [
    ["type": "purchase",
     "total": 11.7,
     "orderId": "DRV1534XC"],
    ["type": "lead",
     "lead": ["topic": "luxury car test drive 2015",
              "value": 22.22,
              "leadId": "xyz123"]]
]

let monitoringParams = LPMonitoringParams(entryPoints: entryPoints, engagementAttributes: engagementAttributes, pageId: "pageId")
let identity = LPMonitoringIdentity(consumerID: "consumerID", issuer: "BrandIssuer")

// SendSDE
LPMonitoringAPI.instance.sendSDE(identities: [identity], monitoringParams: monitoringParams, completion: { (sendSdeResponse) in
    print("received send sde response: \(String(describing: sendSdeResponse))")
}) { [weak self] (error) in
    print("send sde error: \(error.userInfo.description)")
}

// GetEngagement
LPMonitoringAPI.instance.getEngagement(identities: [identity], monitoringParams: monitoringParams, completion: { (getEngagementResponse) in
    print("received get engagement response: \(String(describing: getEngagementResponse))")
}) { [weak self] (error) in
    print("get engagement error: \(error.userInfo.description)")
}

// 3. Show Conversation using Campaign
// LPCampaignInfo parameters are based on the response of getEngagement() using getEngagementResponse (of Type //LPGetEngagementResponse) and includes LPEngagementDetails

let campaignInfo = LPCampaignInfo(campaignId: campaignID, engagementId: engagementID, contextId: contextID)
// Add campaignInfo to conversationQuery
let conversationQuery = LPMessagingSDK.instance.getConversationBrandQuery(accountNumber, campaignInfo: campaignInfo)
let conversationViewParam = LPConversationViewParams(conversationQuery: conversationQuery, isViewOnly: false)
// show conversation using campaignInfo
LPMessagingSDK.instance.showConversation(conversationViewParam)
```

### Notes & Best Practices

* Please follow the steps in the [Campaigns for Messaging guide](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Campaigns/Mobile+App+Engagement+Configuration+Guide.pdf) **before** adding the implementation to a mobile app.

* In order to use the APIs, the SDK should be initialized with the ```LPMonitoringInitParams``` object.

* In order to start a conversation with a specific campaign and engagement, a ```LPCampaignInfo``` object should be provided to the ```LPConversationViewParams``` object

* A monitoring session lasts for a 6 hours window. All SDEs which will be reported during the session will be aggregated.

* In case SDEs aren't reported (idle) for 30 minutes, a new session will be started when reporting the next SDE.
