Important:

When using Custom View Controller Mode, the Conversation view must be removed when leaving the App. To avoid dismissing the View when CSAT/SecureForms/PhotoSharing View is presented, you should only dismiss the Conversation view if Moving From ParentView, as demonstrated below.</div>

```swift
if (self.conversationQuery != nil && self.isMovingToParentViewController){
    LPMessagingSDK.instance.removeConversation(self.conversationQuery!)
}
```

**Note**: When ViewController Mode is used, on the Navigation Bar Back Button, you can simply call **LPMessagingSDK.instance.removeConversation(self.conversationQuery!)**.
