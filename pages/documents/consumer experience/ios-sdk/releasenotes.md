Full release notes can be found [here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/Release+Notes/Mobile+App+SDK+v3.2+Release+Notes+-+iOS.pdf)


### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 3.1.5

Version 3.1.5 supports XCode 9.3 & XCode 9.4

#### Symptom:

Control History APIs are not exposed to Objective C.

#### Fix:

The Control History APIs are now exposed

#### Symptom:

LPMessagingSDKCSATScoreSubmissionDidFinish delegate was called when getting history, even if the CSAT was already submitted.

#### Fix:

LPMessagingSDKCSATScoreSubmissionDidFinish is now called only after the CSAT is submitted.


### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 3.1.4 (identical to 3.1.0.24)
Version 3.1.0.24 - Supports XCode 9.2

Version 3.1.4 - Supports XCode 9.3

#### Symptom:

In some cases where two consumers use the same device (one after the other), push notifications directed to the first consumer were routed to the device although a different consumer was using it.

#### Fix:

Before registering a new consumer for push notification, we make sure the previous consumer was unregistered.

#### Symptom:

In some cases, when using older iOS versions (~iOS 9) and older devices, and fetching additional history, the UI of the conversation screen breaks and from time to time, the app might crash as well.

#### Fix:

The UI will maintain its structure after fetching additional history and prevent a possible crash.


#### Symptom:

After a brand calls to Clear History, the conversation is removed from the UI but when the consumer navigates back to the screen the history is presented again.

#### Fix:

History will not be presented after calling Clear History.


#### Symptom:

In some cases, when the SDK is trying to connect to LivePerson’s servers, there is no indication for the consumer.

#### Fix:

An indication will be presented while the SDK attempts to connect to the server.

### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 3.1.3 (identical to 3.1.0.23)
Version 3.1.0.23 - Supports XCode 9.2

Version 3.1.3 - Supports XCode 9.3

The version contains the following bug fixes:

#### Symptom:
When a consumer scrolls inside the conversation window, returns to the app and then back to the conversation, their position inside the screen is not saved and they need to navigate back to their previous position.

#### Fix:
The consumer’s position within the conversation window is saved. When the consumer returns to the conversation, they will return to the same place they were when they navigated away from the screen.

#### Symptom:
In some cases, when fetching additional history, the UI of the conversation screen breaks.

#### Fix:
The UI will maintain its structure after fetching additional history.

#### Symptom:
When a consumer starts a conversation and leaves the messaging screen while moving the app to background, then returns to the messaging screen after the JWT has expired, they will not be able to continue the conversation and sending messages will be disabled.

#### Fix:
The JWT expiration is now verified before each socket connection. If it expires, a callback of tokenExpired will be invoked.

#### Symptom:
When calling the API of removeConversation() from viewWillDisappear() when the conversation has been resolved, the socket will be closed while the CSAT is being presented to the consumer. As a result, the CSAT submit button is disabled.

#### Fix:
The socket will not be closed while the CSAT is being presented.


### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 3.1.2 (identical to 3.1.0.22)
Version 3.1.0.22 - Supports XCode 9.2

Version 3.1.2 - Supports XCode 9.3

The version contains the following bug fixes:

#### Symptom:
Consumer is typing indication appears to the agent when the keyboard is opened and not when the consumer actually starts typing.

#### Fix:
Consumer is typing view will be presented to agent on a keystroke.

#### Symptom:
When a consumer scrolls inside the conversation window, goes back to the app and back to the conversation, the position inside the screen will not be saved.

#### Fix:
The position inside the screen is saved. When the consumer will go back to the conversation, the position will be the same as it was when leaving the screen.

#### Symptom:
Agent’s first name appears in the in app notification instead of the nickname.

#### Fix:
Added the nickname of the agent instead of the first name.


### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 3.1.1

#### Added support for XCode 9.3 and Swift 4.1



### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 3.1

These are the main feature releases available in the **Mobile App Messaging SDK version 3.1 for iOS**.

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v6.4.pdf){:target="_blank"}


#### New functionalities

##### Campaign for messaging

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

The addition of campaigns for mobile app and web messaging will allow brands to manage their engagements easily and efficiently across these channels, targeting customers based on unauthenticated attributes or locations and routing them to a desired skill.

Being able to track customer activity in all areas of the brand app and provide information on these interactions to LiveEngage boosts agent efficiency and enables more accurate reporting.

Using the Monitoring APIs, brands can:

1. Report on the customer’s journey inside the app

2. Get engagements based on the reported SDEs

3. Route conversations to a specific skill (based on engagements)

##### Monitoring APIs

The below APIs enable brands to use Campaigns for Messaging inside the brand’s app

<table>

##### Conversation History Control

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

To enhance control of customer data retention, scalability and performance, and support the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), open conversations will be loaded from a real time service while closed conversations will be loaded from a history service.

The change will be **seamless** for brands who upgrade to SDK version 3.1. Brands choosing not to upgrade to SDK v3.1 will be able to view the conversation history from the last 14 days. The history stored on the consumer’s device will also be available.

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:*

<table>

##### History and Active Conversation View

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** Yes.

New APIs will give brands control over the conversations presented in the conversation window. For example, brands can choose to present only the last 180 days of conversation history.

These APIs can be used together with getengagement (Monitoring APIs) to decide how to present  conversations history according to whether there is an open conversation or not. For example, if there is no open conversation, brands can present a ‘View conversation history’ button which will present only the closed conversations from the last 180 days.

The new APIs allows:

* Getting an indication if there is an open conversation or not (Monitoring APIs)

* Controlling which conversations will be presented by status (open\closed)

* Controlling the time frame of presented conversations (by days)

 * When using historyConversationsMaxDays, LPConversationHistoryMaxDaysDateType will decide if to filter by the conversations' start date or end date. When not providing a value, startConversationDate will be the default.

### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 2.8.0

**Version 2.8 planned roll-out: September 27th 2017**

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v6.0.pdf){:target="_blank"}

These are the main feature releases available in the **Mobile App Messaging SDK version 2.8 for iOS**.

#### Structured content enablement (GA in SDK)

**Type:** Feature

**Available to all customers?** No - early adopters only.

_The beta version was released in v2.7 (for a full description, refer to the [v2.7 release notes](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/Release+Notes/In-appSDKv2.7_ReleaseNotes-iOS.pdf)). The SDK delivers structured content enablement only; the feature will be made fully productive in October. In v2.8 the feature is enabled by default in the SDK._

The dictionary of template elements can be found [here](https://developers.liveperson.com/structured-content-templates.html).

**What does enablement mean?**

Until rollout is complete, the structured content capability in SDK v2.7 was flagged as a Beta feature. The feature has an enablement toggle in the SDK which was disabled by default.

In SDK v2.8, it is enabled by default.

The toggle may be switched on or off as part of the SDK implementation within the host app, however it is highly recommended not to release the SDK in the host app with structured content enabled until end to end flow has been fully tested on the brand’s account.

**Inapp Messaging SDK toggle** -

* iOS - enableStructuredContent


**Related properties**: Structured content

#### Automatic messages for messaging

**Type:** Feature

**Available to all customers?** No - early adopters only.

**Description**

Automatic Messages (AKA System Messages) are predefined messages about events that occur in the conversation and are sent to the consumer as the events occur. Their purpose is to gain the consumer’s trust in the messaging channel, by setting expectations and giving the consumer visibility over the agent’s availability.

Auto messages are triggered upon specific events that are detected by the system (e.g. the consumer opens a new conversation, the conversation is transferred to another agent, the time to respond is updated, etc.). When the auto messages are sent, they are displayed to the consumer and the agent within the conversation transcript, and they also appear in the conversation’s history both on the consumer’s side and in LE.

**Notes**:

* Messages are supported in all LiveEngage languages.

* The content of each message can be edited by the brand.

* Skill variation is supported, including enabling/disabling the messages for each skill.

* Certain messages can have different parameters, such as the time the conversation is in the queue before the message is sent.

* Dynamic text can be added to the messages, which will be replaced with a runtime value, such as agent name.

* Auto messages do not affect whom the conversation is pending, nor the time to respond.

* They are filtered out of the reports by default (unless manually included).

The following auto messages are supported:

* New conversations

 * A consumer opens a conversation during working hours

 * A consumer opens a conversation for the first time ever, during working hours

* Off hours

 * A consumer opens a conversation during off hours

 * A consumer opens a conversation for the first time ever, during off hours

 * The consumer sends the first message during off hours in an open conversation

* Time to respond

 * The response time is updated manually by the agent

 * The consumer marks the conversation as urgent

 * The consumer dismisses the conversation urgent state

* Consumer/Agent non-responsive

 * The consumer has not responded for X seconds/minutes/hours

 * The agent did not respond for X seconds/minutes/hours

 * Conversation is in queue for X mins/hours

* Transfers and connection to agents

 * The conversation is transferred to a different skill

 * The agent returns the conversation to the queue

 * The consumer is connected to an agent

* Conversation participants

 * Agent manager joins the conversation 	

 * The joined agent manager leaves the conversation 	

**How to enable auto messages**

Auto messages will be enabled for early adopters upon release. Please contact your account manager for more information.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:

When auto messages are enabled, they are all enabled by default and all have the default text. It is advised to review them immediately and modify them to suit the brand’s needs.

Once auto messages are enabled, the SDK does not show toast messages which were presented in the past.

The following messages remain in the SDK :

* Introduction message from the consumer’s first ever conversation. Make sure you do not have a collision between that message and auto messages.

* Conversation resolved message

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:

#### Unread messages badge

When there are unread messages waiting for the consumer within the brand app, this information can be pushed to display in the app’s notification badge. Within the app, brands can develop their own visualization of a badge, such as a number, icon or other marker to show unread messages.

The unread messages number is passed to the SDK through LP Push service with every push.

**IMPORTANT NOTES :**

A push is sent to the last device which was registered to the LP push service, meaning that the unread messages indication can be fetched by only one device.

* If the user is using two devices in parallel, the device that does not receive push events will receive updates of the unread message indicator only once that a message has been sent from that device and the push arrives to it.

* In addition, if a conversation is ongoing in web messaging, then the push will not arrive to the device, since the web-socket is already open.

**Getting the unread message badge counter**

This API method uses a threshold mechanism of 10 seconds from the last time the badge retrieved from the server. If calling this method within less than 10 seconds, the counter will be returned from cache otherwise, it will be fetched again with new data.
​ ​
**Parameters**:

* conversationQuery: conversationQuery: used to identify the related brand

* completion: called once the operation ends successfully

* failure: called once the operation failed

### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 2.7.0

These are the main feature releases available in the Mobile App Messaging SDK version 2.7 for iOS.
Version 2.7 roll-out: September 3rd 2017

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v5.9.pdf){:target="_blank"}

#### New functionalities

##### Structured content enablement (Beta)

![StructuredContent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LP-Messaging/iOS-Messaging-SDK/gh-pages/images/00-structuredContent.jpg)

**This version of the SDK delivers structured content enablement only; the feature will be made fully productive in October.*

**Description**
Structured message templates and elements, such as cards, images and deep linking buttons, turn a simple app interaction into a conversational user experience. They support a huge variety of messaging interactions and enable:

 - Clearer communication with bots, so commands are more easily
   understood.
 - The ability to trigger actions, such as deep-linking navigation,
   confirmations and transactions, directly from a    conversation
 - Improved sales through product promotion and    simplification of the
   purchasing process
 - An overall improved and more    efficient    service - just what
   consumers expect from messaging

**SDK 2.7 structured content capabilities**
Structured content capabilities are being gradually rolled out during September-October 2017.
Dedicated documentation for structured content will be published as part of the gradual rollout.

Mobile App Messaging SDK v2.7 has a structured content renderer for the following elements:

 - Image
 - Text
 - Button
 - Clicks (actions and meta-data)

Full list of elements dictionary will be published during the gradual rollout.

**What does enablement mean?**
Until rollout is complete, the structured content capability in SDK v2.7 is flagged as a Beta feature. The feature has an enablement toggle in the SDK which is disabled by default.

The toggle may be switched on as part of the SDK release within the host app, however it is highly recommended not to release the SDK in the host app with structured content enabled until end to end flow has been fully tested on the brand’s account.

In addition to structured content enablement, SDK v2.7 also has a few branding properties and one callback which can be configured and used.

###### Related properties: [Structured content](#new-properties)

##### Tablet split-screen supportability
![TabletSplitScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LP-Messaging/iOS-Messaging-SDK/gh-pages/images/01-tabletSplitScreen.jpg)
To ensure that consumers using tablets can connect with brands while enjoying the tablet experience, brands can enable tablet applications to host the conversation window within an application page, as a fragment for Android or viewcontroller for iOS.

Until now the SDK has provided support for a full page layout for messaging conversations. SDK 2.7 provides full support for conversations in a split-screen with viewcontroller / fragment modes. Brands can own the wrapper and host the conversation in split-screen.

A full list of supported and certified devices can be found in the LiveEngage System Requirements document.
The following additional conditions and configurations are required:*


| Backend update | Backend enablement | Backend configuration | SDK enablement | SDK configuration |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |


##### Connectivity status bar

##### Secure form branding enhancements
To enable brands to adjust the secure form visuals to accurately reflect their brand experience, the following configurations are now available:

 - Secure form fonts
 - Bubble loader indicator color

The secure form is essentially a web page running in a web view, within the messaging conversation. As such, the web page may run predefined fonts which can be set by the SDK remotely.

By default, the font is set to Helvetica. However brands can choose from any of the fonts on the following secure form supported fonts list:

Aria, Arial, Arial Black, Bookman Old Style, Comic Sans MS, Courier New, Garamond, Georgia, Helvetica, HelveticaNeue, HelveticaNeue-Light, Impact, Lato, Lucida Console, Lucida Sans Unicode, MS Sans Serif, MS Serif, Palatino Linotype, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, Verdana.

##### View-only mode
The SDK now offers a new RunTime mode in addition to the edit mode, known as view-only mode. View-only mode means consumers can see the full conversation, but the keyboard and text input area are not displayed. In this mode, new messages can arrive, but the consumer will not be able to respond.
This mode gives brands greater control over how consumers are able to use messaging within the brand’s app.
Future SDKs will support additional modes.

##### Photo sharing permissions callback
When a consumer shares photos during a conversation, a banner appears asking them to grant permission for the app to have access to their camera and/ or photo library.

If the consumer refuses permission, the SDK sends a callback to the host app. Brands are then able to run a customized and branded banner with a second request for the consumer to grant the appropriate photo sharing permissions.

In order to present a custom banner, brands can create and present a new UIAlertViewController as well as a UIView, and present them on the SDK container ViewController or the root UIWindow.

    class LPConversationViewParams: NSObject {
     	var conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol!
        var containerViewController: UIViewController? // nil = WindowMode
     	var isViewOnly = false
    }

##### LPAuthenticationParams
This class represents an object to determine the properties of an authenticated connection. If using an authenticated connection, this parameter must be passed: LPAuthenticationParams supports Code Flow login or Implicit Flow login. For Implicit Flow, pass 'jwt' parameter only. For Code Flow, pass 'authCode' and 'redirectURI' only.

    class LPAuthenticationParams: NSObject {
        var authenticationCode: String? // Code Flow authentication
        var jwt: String? // Implicit Flow authentication
     	var redirectURI: String? // Code Flow authentication

This method is used to open the conversation screen.

##### New reconnect API

    func reconnect(_ conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol, authenticationParams: LPAuthenticationParams

When using SSO in an authenticated connection, an auth-code is passed to the SDK. The session in this case might have an expiration date. To reconnect with a new token, use the 'reconnect’ API and pass the new token.

This method reconnects the conversation's connection for a conversation query and reconnects open related webSockets and sync the conversation with its latest updates.

#### Deprecated APIs
```
  func showConversation(_ conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol, authenticationCode: String? = nil, containerViewController: UIViewController? = nil)
```
This method has been deprecated in SDK version 2.7.
Use showConversation(_ conversationViewParams: LPConversationViewParams, authenticationParams: LPAuthenticationParams? = nil)

## Mobile App Messaging SDK Version 2.3.1

Mobile App Messaging SDK v2.3.1 for iOS contains the following bug fix:

_Symptom_:

For one minute after the consumer had navigated away from the conversation window, any arriving messages would not display. They would only appear in the conversation window after the minute had passed.

_Fix_:
The following capability which was first introduced in v2.3 has been disabled to avoid this bug : “Presence enablement for photo sharing - beta*”.

### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 2.3.0

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v5.6.pdf){:target="_blank"}


These are the main feature releases available in the **Mobile App Messaging SDK version 2.3 for iOS**.


##### iOS Developer Enhancements

The LiveEngage in-app SDK is fully compatible with the most recent versions of Apple’s developer tools, XCode 8.3 and Swift 3.1.

The SDK is also compatible with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/){:target="_blank"}, a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. CocoaPods has thousands of libraries and is used in over 2 million apps. It can help you scale your projects elegantly and provides a standard format for managing external libraries.

Note: Sample Apps are now using CocoaPods.

**CocoaPods Installation**

1.	Install cocoapods using the following command:

    $ gem install cocoapods

2.	Navigate to your project folder and init new pod using the following command:

    $ pod init

3.	Podfile should be created under your project’s folder.

    To integrate Liveperson Messaging SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

      source 'https://github.com/LivePersonInc/iOSPodSpecs.git'
        platform :ios, '8.0'
      	use_frameworks!

      	target '<Your Target Name>' do
      	    pod 'LPMessagingSDK'
      	end

4.	Run the following command in the terminal under your project folder:

    $ pod install

5.	In project settings, navigate to the Build Phases tab, and click the + button to add a New Run Script Phase. Add the script below in order to loop through the frameworks embedded in the application and remove unused architectures (used for the simulator). This step is a workaround for the [known iOS issue](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216){:target="_blank"} and is necessary for archiving your app before publishing it to the App Store.

```shell
bash "${SRCROOT}/Pods/LPMessagingSDK/LPMessagingSDK/LPInfra.framework/frameworks-strip.sh"
```


##### Secure form for Mobile App Messaging


The secure form gives consumers the confidence to submit sensitive information, such as credit card data and social security numbers, while messaging in-app. The form also enables agents to safely carry out secure processes, such as payment, identification and authorisations.

The form can be tailored to match the Mobile App Messaging experience and has a time-out expiry, for added security.

_This feature requires consulting services support. For more information, please refer to the LiveEngage [secure form for messaging documentation](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/security/Secure+form+for+messaging.pdf){:target="_blank"}_.

##### Presence enablement for photo sharing - beta*
Presence enablement for photo sharing provides consumers with the ability to receive notifications while uploading a photo, whether they remain within the app or keep it running in the background.

The Web Socket remains open for a maximum of 60 seconds (using Background Task) when the app or conversation window moves to the background. This scenario is also applicable for non photo sharing flows.

*Photo sharing is a beta feature*.

### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 2.0

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v5.0.pdf){:target="_blank"}


These are the main feature releases available in the Mobile App Messaging SDK version 2.0.


##### Photo sharing for iOS and Android (Beta)

Consumers can now add photos directly into a messaging conversation, enabling them to describe an item and share it with their agent. Photo sharing supports multiple image sizes, and all shared images are logged in All Connections. This feature is available for Facebook messenger, web messaging, and Mobile App Messaging, on both Android and iOS.

![Release Notes Photo Sharing](img/releasenotessharing.png)


##### Accessibility for messaging


The Mobile App Messaging SDK now supports accessibility WCAG Level A and Level AA and CATO.

![Release Note Accessibility](img/releasenotesaccessibility.png)


##### Configure regular expressions to create hyperlinks in messages


Brands can now configure their own regular expressions to create hyperlinks which link directly to relevant pages or actions.

Expressions can be configured for the following commands:

*	Call
*	Email
*	URL

![Release Notes Hyperlinks](img/releasenotes1.png)


##### In-conversation shortcut to new messages


A shortcut can now be configured to appear within the conversation when there are new messages available. This saves the consumer time when scrolling within messaging conversations. Clicking on the shortcut navigates the visitor straight to the new messages so they can quickly and easily continue the conversation.

![Release Note In-conversation](img/releasenotesinconversation.png)


##### Set icon for send button


Brands now have the ability to replace the Send button in a messaging conversation with a paper plane (Android) or arrow (iOS). This icon can be customized to match the brand’s colors.

![Release Notes Set Icon](img/releasenotesseticon.png)


##### Link preview within conversation


When sending a link within an Mobile App Messaging conversation, a preview of the link page will display within the thread, giving the consumer a useful overview of the link content.

![Release Notes Link Preview](img/releasenoteslinkpreview.png)


##### Ability to remove resolved divider in thread


Brands are now able to configure the removal of the resolved divider within a thread. The divider usually appears underneath the system message noting that the conversation has been resolved. This creates the feel of one ongoing, undisrupted conversation for consumers using messaging.

![Release Notes Ability to Remove](img/releasenotesability1.png) ![Release Notes Ability to Remove](img/releasenotesability2.png)


##### Add callback to SDK for agent picture click


In order to provide brands with greater insight into consumer activity within the messaging window, LiveEngage will provide a callback when a consumer clicks on the agent’s picture in the conversation. The brand can then decide what action they would like to take, for example opening an agent profile or enlarging the picture.

![Release Notes Add Callback](img/releasenotescallback.png)


##### Enhancement: Configure CSAT Timeout


Brands can now configure for how long a CSAT form will be displayed to the consumer after the messaging conversation is resolved by the agent. This applies to consumers who exit the conversation before it is resolved.

Brands can select from the following options:
-	The CSAT form never times out, and will be displayed to the consumer when they reopen the conversation regardless of the amount of time that has passed since the conversation was resolved.

-	The number of minutes from when the conversation was resolved to when the form will no longer be displayed.
