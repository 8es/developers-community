### Introduction
Certificate Pinning allows an increased security on top of the commonly used SSL for mobile apps. It assists to prevent certificate hijacks or compromised certificate authorities implications. By using Certificate Pinning, mobile apps have an additional validation of the server’s certificate.
In order to use the feature, the brand will need to use the Vanity URL feature. Once the onboarding to Vanity URL is completed, the brand will be able to implement the feature inside its app.
In order to use the feature, the brand will need to go through an onboarding process which includes the following steps:
  * Request to use the feature from the account team
  * Filling the Vanity URL feature request form
  * Purchasing a SAN certificate according to a CSR which will be provided by the account team
  * Providing the purchased certificate to LivePerson
  * LivePerson internal configuration

The duration of the onboarding process will be according to LivePerson's SLA.

### Using the Feature

   **Please note** - Using the described functionality without having the feature configured will result in failures while trying to communicate with LivePerson’s servers.

### iOS
In order to add the feature on iOS, please perform the following steps:
1. Add the domains for lptag and csds (both will be provided by the account team)
   `LPConfig.defaultConfiguration.csdsDomain = "<SOME DOMAIN>"`
   `LPConfig.defaultConfiguration.lpTagDomain = "<SOME DOMAIN>"`
   The configuration should be added anywhere inside the code **before** calling the method `showConversation(conversationViewParams, authenticationParams: authenticationParams)`
2. Adding the public keys to the SDK - The brand should extract the public keys of the SAN certificate that was provided to LivePerson. The keys should be added to the object `LPAuthenticationParams`.
Multiple keys can be added, as long as one of the keys will match the returned key, the connection will be initiated.

#### Code Sample
```c
func certPinningExample() {

  LPConfig.defaultConfiguration.csdsDomain = "<SOME DOMAIN>"
  LPConfig.defaultConfiguration.lpTagDomain = "<SOME DOMAIN>"

  let conversationQuery = LPMessagingSDK.instance.getConversationBrandQuery("accountNumber")
  let conversationViewParams = LPConversationViewParams(conversationQuery: conversationQuery, containerViewController: self, isViewOnly: false)
  let authenticationParams = LPAuthenticationParams(certPinningPublicKeys: ["key1", "key2", "key3"])

  LPMessagingSDK.instance.showConversation(conversationViewParams, authenticationParams: authenticationParams)
}
```
