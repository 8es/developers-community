### Webhooks Capabilities Configuration

A registration of an application to receive Webhooks (WH) notifications is achieved by enabling the “webhooks” capability of that application. This is done by adding the “webhooks” json attribute inside the “capabilities” section of the [**App Installation JSON**](app-install-manifest-connectors.html){:target="_blank"}.

Here is an example of such configuration:

```json
{
    "client_name": "App name",
    "enabled": true,
    "logo_uri": "URL for your logo",
    ...
    "capabilities": {
      "webhooks": {
        "ms.MessagingEventNotification.ContentEvent": {
          "endpoint": "https://www.application.endpoint.com/",
          "max_retries": 1
        },
         "ms.MessagingEventNotification.RichContentEvent": {
          "endpoint": "https://www.application.endpoint.com/"
         },
         "ms.MessagingEventNotification.ChatStateEvent": {
          "endpoint": "https://www.application.endpoint.com/"
        },
        "cqm.ExConversationChangeNotification": {
          "endpoint": "https://www.application.endpoint.com/",
	       "max_retries": 3
        }
      }
    }
}
```

**Note**: the `enabled` key accepts a boolean value.

The “webhooks” JSON key is a map, of which each entry is a single notification registration. Each entry consists of the following:

* key (string) - the event type (for example, "ms.MessagingEventNotification.ContentEvent")

* value (JSON) - the attributes of the notification, including:

  * endpoint (mandatory) - the SSL secured HTTP url to which to send the notification.

  * max_retries (optional) - maximum number of retry attempts for a failed notification request (possible values: 0 - 5; default value: 0).
