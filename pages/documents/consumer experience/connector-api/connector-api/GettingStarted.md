### Getting Started with the Connector API

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html){:target="_blank"} to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

	* asyncMessagingEnt

2. [Here are the API terms of use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou){:target="_blank"}.

3. When using this API, it is recommended that you implement our [Retry Policy and KeepAlive best practices](guides-retry-policy.html){:target="_blank"}

[comment]: <> (guides-retry-policy.html needs to be updated with Connector API as well)

**In order to get started with the Connector API, please follow the steps below:**

1. **Onboard your connector**

	The connector is a server application that is used to make HTTPS calls on behalf of consumers to LiveEngage. For that purpose, the application must be registered and known to LiveEngage for authorization and user validation. This process can happen before even writing one line of code.

	In order to register your application, please contact your Account Management team. You will need to provide details regarding your connector application, via a pre-determined JSON schema (otherwise known as the Application Installation Manifest). Use the default [App Installation Manifest](AppInstallJSON.html) and replace or fill in the required information.

	The main sections to be filled are (Refer to the [JSON](AppInstallJSON.html) for more information):

	* Your **connector/application name** (`client_name` and optionally also the `description`).

	* **Webhooks URL endpoints** which will be used as URL endpoints for LiveEngage to send its notification events to your connector.

	* **Engagement related fields** - this affects the Engagement design possibilities when designing a campaign for messaging. Without a clear reason to change them, you can use the default values found in the schema.

	After filling in the [JSON Template](AppInstallJSON.html) with the required data, please contact your Account Management team to register your connector application.


2. **Getting an application JWT** - After successfully registering your connector, you will be given two important parameter values which will serve to authorize your connector application prior to using the Connector API:


`Installation id`:  e.g., 75588e18-0213-4e33-8174-883acac7e3c4

`Secret`:  e.g kgvbkk7glku72jgtmpi6l4a872

These will be used for the first authorization request to LiveEngage in order to identify your connector and provide it with an **AppJWT**.

**Request Example**

https://{Sentinel_Domain}/sentinel/api/account/{SiteID}/app/token?v=1.0&grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={Installation id}&client_secret={Secret}

Refer to [Getting an AppJWT](Create_AppJWT.html){:target="_blank"} for more information.


3. **Getting a consumer JWS** - An **AppJWT** is not sufficient to identify a consumer with LiveEngage. With a valid AppJWT, you can obtain a consumer JWS (Java Web Signature) to identify the consumer in LiveEngage:

**Request Example**

https://{domain}/api/account/{accountid}/consumer?v=1.0|

Refer to [Getting a ConsumerJWS](Create_ConsumerJWS.html){:target="_blank"} for more information.

4. **Develop and run your connector** - refer to the [API Overview](connector-api-overview.html){:target="_blank"} to get started.
