### Introduction

A connector is a piece of code which "connects" LiveEngage and an external messaging application (e.g. SMS gateway, Facebook, Apple Business Chat, LINE etc.) The Connector API enables communication for any connectors by sending and receiving events via HTTPS (REST methods) from an external messaging application and routing it to LiveEngage.

LiveEngage already provides out of the box connectors for Facebook, Google My Business, SMS via Twilio and Line, with many more in the pipeline, including the Apple Business Chat connector. This API is meant for customers who want to connect with any other messaging platform of their choice, such as Viber, Skype, and SMS (not via Twilio) by building their own connector. The API also allows brands to develop their own connector in collaboration with a third party partner.

**What is the Connector API?**

The Connector API is split into two main components:

* **[WebHooks](webhooks-overview.html){:target="_blank"} Notification Service**: This component receives updates and notifications from a third party app and delivers them to the customer's connector via REST calls. The framework of these calls is based on the [Messaging Window API](consumer-int-overview.html){:target="_blank"}.

* **The Messaging SEND API**: The API allows the customer's connector to then send requests based on the [Messaging Window API](consumer-int-overview.html){:target="_blank"} framework to LiveEngage.

Please note: A HTTP-based transport system for asynchronous communication requires that the brand expose their own HTTPS endpoints with authentication. For more details on WebHooks and how their authentication works, please refer to the [Webhooks documentation](webhooks-overview.html){:target="_blank"}.


**When should I use the Connector API?**

The Connector API should be used when planning to develop a server application which connects consumers with the LiveEngage platform. It should be used to build external consumer connectors. For example, you can integrate your own SMS gateway or Messaging application into LiveEngage.

The HTTPS-based transport in the Connector API is optimized for server-to-server communication. This means that it is optimized for developing a broker application between the messages and data of one platform (such as Facebook, Apple Business Chat, Twitter etc.) and LiveEngage messages and data.

In all other cases, such as when planning to develop a messaging frontend application, client application or a customized chat window, the [Messaging Window API](consumer-int-overview.html){:target="_blank"} is the preferred method.


|  																		 | **Connector API**           | **Messaging Window API**    |
| ------------------------------------ |:----------------------------|:----------------------------|
| **Transport protocol**               | HTTPS                             | WebSockets                  |
| **Application type**                 | Backend (server to server)        | Frontend                    |  
| **Modality**                         | Asynchronous, no realtime         | Asynchronous, near realtime |
| **Authentication**                   | As app w/ auth token (AppJWT)     | As consumer (ConsumerJWT)   |
| **Consumer communication**           | Yes                               | Yes                         |
| **Agent (bot) communication**        | No                           | No, see [Node Agent SDK](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/node-agent-sdk){:target="_blank"} for more info|
| **Compatibility with Function-as-a-Service (“Lambdas”)**  | Yes          | No                          |

**How does the Connector API differ from the Messaging Window API?**

The Connector API uses a different transport protocol: **HTTPS** instead of **Web Sockets**. However, the types of API requests, responses, and notifications are largely based on the Messaging Window API with several exceptions:

* There are no subscription requests. Subscriptions are specified when installing a client application.

* A consumer conversation is created with a dedicated endpoint and there is no connection initialization.

* The mechanisms for authentication and consumer identification are different.


### Use Cases

There are two primary reasons to utilize the Connector API:

1. **Consumers** - To **create** and **host** their own custom connectors - To enable their consumers to engage with them via many distribution channels while using more than one device. e.g Connector for **Facebook Messenger, Google my business, Apple Business Chat, LINE** etc.

2. **Product solutions** -

	* Develop custom connectors for brands (e.g., SMS gateway) - For our customers that do not wish to use the default Twilio SMS Gateway. This gateway will be hosted at Live Person.


The Connector API allows the Connector to:

* Create Conversation and set SDEs in one step.

* Send messages (their content is determined by the Payload sent)

* Send Images

* Chat States Events (ACTIVE, INACTIVE etc.)

* Close Conversations

The Webhooks allows the connector to:

- Subscribe to notifications from messaging.
