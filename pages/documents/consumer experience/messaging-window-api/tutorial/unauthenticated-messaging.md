LiveEngag expects to receive a token for every messaging conversation. If you would like to have unauthenticated messaging conversations (where the consumer remains "anonymous"), you will need to provide an "unauthenticated" (not containing any details on the consumer) ID Token to LiveEngage. In this tutorial you will learn how to create a token for unauthenticated consumers.

### Prerequisites

In order to work with unauthenticated conversation, your account must be provisioned by an LPA (LivePerson Administrator) to enable the ``Messaging.Un_Auth_Messaging`` feature and create aa unauthenticated connector (ACR0 Connector). The LPA should supply to you the ``CONNECTOR_ID`` that is required in beginning of the flow.

First, lanuch a shell for your account with the ``CONNECTOR_ID`` supplied by your LPA:

```sh
docker run --env LP_ACCOUNT=__YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID__ --env LP_CONN_ID=__CONNECTOR_ID__ -it lpinc/shell
```

### Step 1 - Create an Unauthenticated External JWT

```sh
LP_EXT_JWT=`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://$LP_IDP/api/account/$LP_ACCOUNT/anonymous/authorize | jq -r .token`
```


### Step 2 - Exchange the External JWT with internal token

```sh
LP_JWT=`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id_token" : "'$LP_EXT_JWT'"}' https://$LP_IDP/api/account/$LP_ACCOUNT/app/$LP_APP_CONN_ID/authenticate?v=3.0 | jq -r .token`
```

### Step 3 - Create a Conversation

Now you can continue the regular flow as documented in the [Getting Started](consumer-int-getting-started.html#step-3---connect-to-the-messaging-service).


### Step 4 - Refresh an External Token
Once the external token is expired (10 minutes by default), you can still refresh it for a certain period of time (730 hours by default) using the following call:

```sh
LP_EXT_JWT=`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "id_token":"'$LP_EXT_JWT'" }' https://$LP_IDP/api/account/$LP_ACCOUNT/anonymous/authorize | jq -r .token`
```

Make sure that the ``LP_EXT_JWT`` contains the previous external token you created in step 1. Using the fresh external token you can continue to step 2.
