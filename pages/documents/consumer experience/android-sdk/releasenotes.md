**In-App Messaging SDK version 3.0 for Android**.

**Version 3.0 planned roll-out: January 14th 2018**

#### New functionalities

##### Certificate Pinning

**Type:** Developer Experience Feature

**Available to all customers?** No. Contact support for more details.

Certificate Pinning allows an increased security on top of the commonly used SSL for mobile apps. It assists to prevent certificate hijacks or compromised certificate authorities implications. By using Certificate Pinning, apps have an additional validation of the server’s certificate.

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:*

<table>
 <tr>
 <td>Backend update</td>
 <td>Backend enablement</td>
 <td>Backend configuration </td>
 <td>SDK enablement </td>
 <td>SDK configuration </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>No</td>
 <td>Yes</td>

A full list of supported and certified devices can be found in the [LiveEngage System Requirements document](https://ce-sr.s3.amazonaws.com/CA/Admin/Sys%20req/System%20requirements.pdf).

#### New APIs

##### Cert-Pinning API

**Available to all customers?** No. Contact support for more details.

**Please note** Using the described APIs without having the feature configured will result in failures while trying to communicate with LivePerson’s servers.

For Fragment window

**public static Fragment getConversationFragment(LPAuthenticationParams lpAuthenticationParams, ConversationViewParams params‎) **

For Activity window

**public static boolean showConversation(Activity activity, LPAuthenticationParams lpAuthenticationParams, ConversationViewParams params‎****)**

Please add the following new parameter:

**private List<String> ****mCertificatePinningKeys**

This API allows you to set the certificate public key hash. This API can receive multiple public key hashes so that it has the ability to support more than one key. If the certificate provider changes their public key, we will still be able to validate the keys of the other certificate providers. If this field is left empty, the Cert Pinning is disabled.

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:*

<table>
 <tr>
 <td>Backend update</td>
 <td>Backend enablement</td>
 <td>Backend configuration </td>
 <td>SDK enablement </td>
 <td>SDK configuration </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Yes</td>
 <td>Yes</td>
 <td>Yes</td>
 <td>Yes</td>
 <td>Yes</td>
 </tr>
</table>


#### New Callbacks

##### Cert Pinning callback

onError(TaskType.INVALID_CERTIFICATE)

If the socket is closed due to certificate error, we broadcast an intent with action "BROADCAST_CONNECTING_TO_SERVER_ERROR"

Delegate which is called when the Cert pinning mechanism failed. The server trust was successfully evaluated but did not contain any of the configured public keys pins. or The server trusts’ evaluation failed: the server's certificate chain is not trusted.

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:*

<table>

### In-App Messaging SDK version 2.8 for Android

These are the main feature releases available in the In-App Messaging SDK version 2.8 for Android.

Version 2.8 roll-out: October 3rd 2017

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v6.0.pdf){:target="_blank"}

### New functionalities

#### Structured content enablement (GA in SDK)

**Type**:​ Feature

**Available​ ​to​ ​all​ ​customers?​** ​No - early adopters only

_The beta version was released in v2.7 (for a full description, refer to the v2.7 release notes). The SDK delivers structured content enablement only; the feature will be made fully productive in October. In v2.8 the feature is enabled by default in the SDK._

The dictionary of template elements can be found [here](https://developers.liveperson.com/structured-content-templates.html).

**What​ ​does​ ​enablement​ ​mean**?

Until rollout is complete, the structured content capability in SDK v2.7 was flagged as a Beta feature. The feature has an enablement toggle in the SDK which was disabled by default. In SDK v2.8, it is enabled by default.

The toggle may be switched on or off as part of the SDK implementation within the host app, however it is highly recommended not to release the SDK in the host app with structured content enabled until end to end flow has been fully tested on the brand’s account.

**In-app​ ​Messaging​ ​SDK​ ​toggle**​ -

* Android - `enable_structured_content`

Related​ ​properties:​ ​Structured content

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:

|Backend update |Backend enablement|Backend configuration|SDK enablement|SDK configuration|
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|
|Yes| Yes| Yes| Yes| Yes|

#### Automatic messages for messaging

**Type**:​ Feature

**Available​ ​to​ ​all​ ​customers**?​ ​No - early adopters only

**Description**

Automatic Messages (AKA System Messages) are predefined messages about events that occur in the conversation and are sent to the consumer as the events occur. Their purpose is to gain the consumer’s trust in the messaging channel, by setting expectations and giving the consumer visibility over the agent’s availability.

Auto messages are triggered upon specific events that are detected by the system (e.g. the consumer opens a new conversation, the conversation is transferred to another agent, the time to respond is updated, etc.). When the auto messages are sent, they are displayed to the consumer and the agent within the conversation transcript, and they also appear in the conversation’s history both on the consumer’s side and in LE.

**Notes**:

* Messages are supported in all LiveEngage languages.
* The content of each message can be edited by the brand.
* Skill variation is supported, including enabling/disabling the messages for each skill.
* Certain messages can have different parameters, such as the time the conversation is in the queue before the message is sent.
* Dynamic text can be added to the messages, which will be replaced with a runtime value, such as agent name.
* Auto messages do not affect whom the conversation is pending, nor the time to respond.
* They are filtered out of the reports by default (unless manually included).

The following auto messages are supported:

* New conversations

  * A consumer opens a conversation during working hours
  * A consumer opens a conversation for the first time ever, during working hours

* Off hours

  * A consumer opens a conversation during off hours
  * A consumer opens a conversation for the first time ever, during off hours
  * The consumer sends the first message during off hours in an open conversation

* Time to respond

  * The response time is updated manually by the agent
  * The consumer marks the conversation as urgent
  * The consumer dismisses the conversation urgent state

* Consumer/Agent non-responsive

  * The consumer has not responded for X seconds/minutes/hours
  * The agent did not respond for X seconds/minutes/hours
  * Conversation is in queue for X mins/hours

* Transfers and connection to agents

  * The conversation is transferred to a different skill
  * The agent returns the conversation to the queue
  * The consumer is connected to an agent

* Conversation participants

  * Agent manager joins the conversation
  * The joined agent manager leaves the conversation

**How​ ​to​ ​enable​ ​auto​ ​messages**

Auto messages will be enabled for early adopters upon release. Please contact your account manager for more information.

**IMPORTANT​ ​NOTES**​:

When auto messages are enabled, they are all enabled by default and all have the default text. It is advised to review them immediately and modify them to suit the brand’s needs. Once auto messages are enabled, the SDK does not show toast messages which were presented in the past.

The following messages remain in the SDK:

* Introduction message from the consumer’s first ever conversation. Make sure you do not have a collision between that message and auto messages.

* Conversation resolved message

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:

|Backend update |Backend enablement|Backend configuration|SDK enablement|SDK configuration|
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|
|Yes| Yes| Yes| Yes| Yes|

#### Unread messages badge

When there are unread messages waiting for the consumer within the brand app, this information can be pushed to display in the app’s notification badge. Within the app, brands can develop their own visualization of a badge, such as a number, icon or other marker to show unread messages.

The unread messages number is passed to the SDK through LP Push service with every push.

**IMPORTANT​ ​NOTES**​​
:
The number of unread messages are fetched by the API from the pusher regardless of whether it’s registered to the LP push service.

**Getting the unread message badge counter**

This API method uses a threshold mechanism of 10 seconds from the last time the badge retrieved from the server. If calling this method within less than 10 seconds, the counter will be returned from cache otherwise,
it will be fetched again with new data.

**Parameters**​:

* conversationQuery: conversationQuery: used to identify the related brand

* completion: called once the operation ends successfully

* failure: called once the operation failed

**Related​ ​properties**:​ ​Unread messages badge
**Related​ ​API**:​ Unread messages badge API

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:

|Backend update |Backend enablement|Backend configuration|SDK enablement|SDK configuration|
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|
|Yes| No| No| No| Yes|

_Key for items as follows_:

**Backend​ ​update**:​ This feature requires an update to the backend.
**Backend​ ​enablement**​: This feature requires items to be toggled on in the backend.
**Backend​ ​configuration**​: This feature requires configuration in the backend.
**SDK​ ​enablement**:​ This feature requires items to be toggled on in the SDK.
**SDK​ ​configuration​**: This features requires items to be configured in the SDK.

### New properties

#### Structured Content

The following properties for structured content can now be configured:

|Name|Description|Default|
|----|-----------|-------|
|&lt;bool name="enable_structured_content"&gt;|Enable or Disable toggle for Structured Content feature in conversations.|True|

### New APIs

#### Unread Messages Badge APIs

```javascript
public​ ​static​ ​void​ ​getNumUnreadMessages(String​ ​appId,​ ​final​ ​ICallback<Integer,
Exception>​ ​callback)​ ​{
​ ​ ​ ​if​ ​(!isValidState())​ ​{
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​callback.onError(new​ ​Exception("SDK​ ​not​ ​initialized"));
​ ​ ​ ​}​ ​else​ ​{
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​MessagingFactory.getInstance().getController().getUnreadMessagesCount(mBrandId,
appId,​ ​callback);
​ ​ ​ ​}
}
```

To use this API, the SDK must be after initialization.

### In-App Messaging SDK version 2.5 for Android

These are the main feature releases available in the In-App Messaging SDK version 2.5 for Android.

Version 2.5 roll-out: July 2nd 2017

[Version Specific System Requirements Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements+v5.8.pdf){:target="_blank"}


### New functionalities

#### Custom fonts

In order for consumers to enjoy the full brand experience while messaging in-app, brands are able to configure certified operating system fonts to appear in the messaging window. The fonts can be used across all elements, or only for the font within the message bubble.

The SDK also supports the use of a brand’s own customized fonts (although these are not certified).

Custom fonts are not supported for Native iOS properties such as:
* Activity mode - Overflow menu
* Popup messages

![Conversation Custom Font](img/CustomFont.png)

Conversation Custom Fonts

![Non Conversation Custom Font](img/NonConversation.png)

Non Conversation Custom Fonts

_Related properties_: Custom fonts

The following additional conditions and configurations are required:*

| Backend update  | Backend enablement  | Backend configuration  | SDK enablement  | SDK configuration  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Yes |

#### New way to listen to LP events via local intents

A new method of listening to LP events has been added. This method allows the host app to register to receive a specific action or to receive all of them. All of the actions match and correspond to the existing callback method. LivePerson recommends using the SDK’s Broadcast Receiver to receive these intent actions, as this system allows the user to listen to specific actions, and is not reliant on the SDK’s life cycle.

Note: Brands can still choose to use the callback method, which remains valid and supported.

_Related APIs_: LivePersonIntents API

#### Presence enablement for photo sharing - beta

Presence enablement for photo sharing provides consumers with the ability to receive notifications while uploading a photo, whether they remain within the app or keep it running in the background. The Web Socket remains open for a maximum of 5 seconds when the app moves to the background. This scenario is also applicable for non photo sharing flows.

In addition, brands can also customize notifications for photo sharing, indicating to the consumer when a photo is loading, has successfully sent or has failed to send

![Presence Enablement](img/releasepresence.png)

Related API: Photo sharing
Related strings: Photo sharing upload status


#### In-app unread messages badge enablement

When there are unread messages waiting for the consumer within the brand app, this information can be pushed to display in the app’s notification badge. Within the app, brands can develop their own visualisation of a badge, such as a number, icon or other marker to show unread messages.

![Unread Messages Badge](img/releaseunread.png)

Related API: Handle Push Message, Get Num Unread Messages, Deprecated API


#### Secure form for in-app messaging

The secure form gives consumers the confidence to submit sensitive information, such as credit card data and social security numbers, while messaging in-app. The form also enables agents to safely carry out secure processes, such as payment, identification and authorisations. The form can be tailored to match the in-app messaging experience and has a time-out expiry, for added security.

_This feature requires consulting services support. For more information, please refer to the LiveEngage ​[secure form for messaging documentation​](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/security/Secure+form+for+messaging.pdf){:target="_blank"}_.

#### New APIS


**handlePushMessage**

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| context | A context from the host app. |
| data | A Bundle that contains the message. The bundle should hold a string with key named "message". |
| brandId | The account ID. |
| showNotification | Used to instruct the SDK to either show or not show a notification to the user. If you wish your app will handle the display of the notification you can set this as false. |

All incoming push messages are received by the host app. The host app can choose to fully handle any push message and display a notification message, or partially handle it and allow the SDK to display the notification. In a case the host app decides to show its own custom notification, it can call handlePushMessage() with the ​showNotification​ parameter set to false and will parse and return a PushMessage object. In case the push message is not related to the SDK, it will return null.

_Note: For the unread messages feature to work correctly, the host app must call this method upon receiving SDK push messages (whether showing a custom notification or not)_.

**getNumUnreadMessages**

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| brandId | The account ID. |

This returns the counter of the unread messages to the number of push messages received.
This number is set to 0 when opening the conversation screen.

To get updates on the unread messages counter: create a BroadcastReceiver that will listen to the following Action:

_LivePerson.ACTION_LP_UPDATE_NUM_UNREAD_MESSAGES_ACTION;_

To get the number of unread messages out of the intent, use the following extra key:

_LivePerson.ACTION_LP_UPDATE_NUM_UNREAD_MESSAGES_EXTRA;_

**Photo Sharing**

Set a pending intent for the image upload foreground service notification -

`setImageServicePendingIntent(PendingIntent pendingIntent)`

Set a notification builder for the image upload foreground service notification -

`setImageServiceUploadNotificationBuilder(Notification.Builder builder)`

Set a notification builder for the image down foreground service notification -

`setImageServiceDownloadNotificationBuilder(Notification.Builder builder)`


#### Deprecated API


The following API has been deprecated:

`public static void handlePush(Context context, Bundle data, String brandId, boolean
showNotification)`

Please use the above ​handlePushMessage()​ method instead.
