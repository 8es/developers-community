### Presence enablement for photo sharing - beta
Presence enablement for photo sharing provides consumers with the ability to receive notifications while uploading a photo, whether they remain within the app or keep it running in the background. The Web Socket remains open for a maximum of 5 seconds when the app moves to the background. This scenario is also applicable for non photo sharing flows.

In addition, brands can also customize notifications for photo sharing, indicating to the consumer when a photo is loading, has successfully sent or has failed to send
