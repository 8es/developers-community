Push and local notifications are a key factor that make the experience better for consumers - they never have to stay in your app or keep the window open as they will get a proactive notification as soon as a reply or notice is available.

_**Note:** In order to enable push notifications, you must also configure them within the LiveEngage UI. See instructions below._

To implement push notifications on the client side:

- Get your app’s AppKey from [Google GCM](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm){:target="_blank"} or [Google FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/){:target="_blank"} and set it in the LiveEngage backend, as explained below, to identify your app by LiveEngage.
- On every app launch get the GCM Token from your device and register it on the LiveEngage push service using the [registerLPPusher()](android-registerlppusher.html){:target="_blank"} API call so it knows which device should get each push message.
- Upon receiving a push message to your app, [handle](android-handlepush.html){:target="_blank"} it so it is displayed to the customer.


```swift
public class MyFirebase extends FirebaseMessagingService {
  /**
   * Called when message is received.
   * @param remoteMessage Object representing the message received from Firebase Cloud Messaging.
   */
  @Override
  public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) {
    // Sends the message into the SDK
    LivePerson.handlePushMessage(this, remoteMessage.getData(), lpAccount, true);
  }
}
```

Important:


**The proprietary SDK notification is only for display purposes, interacting with it won't launch the Application or navigate to the Conversation Fragment/Activity, for a fully interactive notification, the host app needs to provide the implementation.**</div>
