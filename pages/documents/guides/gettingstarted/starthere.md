### What is the Developer Community?

Welcome to LivePerson's Developer Community! This site's purpose is to provide you with in-depth documentation on LivePerson APIs and SDKs. This documentation will cover the basic information on every API (like its calls, methods, data structures and more) as well as more complex flows and applications. If you find any issue with the documentation, please don't hesitate to [visit the site's GitHub repository](hub.com/LivePersonInc/developers-community) and let us know!

If you're looking for support with any of the documents or APIs on the site, please don't hesitate to contact our Dev Support team directly. They are fully versed in the documentation published on this site and will be happy to assist you with any issue which you might encounter.

**The Developer's Community is comprised of the following sections:**

* Guides - this section includes general guides to using our APIs and SDKs. These work across all of our APIs except where otherwise mentioned. In this section you can find documents like Authentication, how to retrieve API keys, using Engagement Attributes and more.

* Consumer Experience - this section includes documentation pertaining to features which impact, manipulate or influence the consumer experience (i.e. the interface with which a consumer starts an interaction with your brand). This section includes useful documentation like our Mobile App Messaging SDK (used to integrate messaging right into your native application), the Messaging Window API (used to customize and create messaging windows) and the Connector API (used to build connector applications which integrate LiveEngage with many third party messaging platforms).

* Agent Interactions - this section includes documentation pertaining to agent behavior, workspace and features. Important documents include the Messaging Agent SDK (which enables bots as agents and handles sending messages to and from those bots), the Chat Agent API (which allows you to control how chat messages get sent to and from your agents) and the Agent Workspace Widget SDK (which allows you to create and integrate custom widgets into the LiveEngage agent workspace).

* Data - this section includes documentation pertaining to LivePerson's data storage, analysis and reporting capabilities. These documents allow you to poll LivePerson servers yourself, retrieving various data types yourselves for use in your own reporting tools. Main documents include the Data Access API (which allows you access to your account's data across all segments), the Messaging Operations API (which retrieves useful information at the contact center level, allowing agent managers to make their call centers more efficient) and the Engagement History API (which focuses on retrieving messaging interaction history and transcripts).

* Real Time Interactions - this section includes documentation pertaining to events which are fired or information that is passed during a conversation. These documents include the Engagement Window Widget SDK (which allows you to integrate third party web services to the engagement window, extending its functionality),
