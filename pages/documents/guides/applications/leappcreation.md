### Overview

Currently, installation of LiveEngage Applications is performed by LivePerson's internal resources (account team, DevSupport, Tier 1, etc). In order to request this installation, you must first fill out the following schema according to your application needs. Once that is done, please contact the relevant LivePerson resource for your account and they will perform the installation.

Once the application has been installed, the LivePerson resource will send you your application key and secret which are required for OAuth2.0 authentication. In the future, installing an application will be possible on your own through LiveEngage, but currently the installation process must be followed.

**Note**: the Connectors API is the only use case for LiveEngage Applications at the moment but we are planning to develop and launch more LiveEngage Applications related use cases in the future.
