Version 3.9 of the Mobile Messaging SDK added the ability for agents or bots within LiveEngage to share a reference photo or photos of any product to visually guide consumers with product awareness, steps on how to use the product, or review comments of a product. The agent can also share photos in a resolved conversation to resume the conversation with the consumer. 

Once sent, the consumer gets a notification only if push notifications are enabled. Otherwise, when the consumer returns to the conversation screen, a thumbnail for a photo appears in the conversation. The consumer can tap on the photo to view it full screen or share it through the default app on their device.  

{:.important}
Consumers cannot download images; they can only preview or share images. 


### Supported file formats

- PNG

- JPG/JPEG

- GIF (non-animated) - previewed as a static image only


### Photo sizes

- Thumbnail - 30 KB (base64-encoded)

- Max upload size allowed - 5 MB uncompressed 
   
   **For SDKs previous to 3.8.** The max upload size allowed is 3 MB. 

### Notes and limitations

- Consumers cannot download images; they can only preview or share images.  

- Photo sharing is two way (agent-to-consumer and consumer-to-agent), but file sharing is one way only (agent to consumer). 

   **For SDKs previous to 3.8:** Photo-sharing is one-way only (from consumer-to-agent, but not vice versa) and available for the Mobile Message SDK only.

- The default value for photos stored on the device is 20, which is configurable with the `maxNumberOfSavedFilesOnDisk` attribute.  If exceeding the max value of photos or files, the SDK deletes the oldest file.

- If an attempt to view a photo is unsuccessful, an error icon covers the thumbnail.  

- The consumer can return to a resolved conversation to view the photos, as long as the photos are part of the conversation history.

- If an agent sends an unsupported file, a message displays indicating the file type shared with the consumer is not supported, and the agent should retry sending a supported file format.

- For authenticated users, backgrounding the app while loading the photo does not get interrupted. 

- For unauthenticated sessions, consumers must tap the photo again with each visit or refresh of the conversation because the history gets cleared when a session expires or logs the consumer out.

- iOS supports the preview of file types per iOS operating system.


### Custom View Controller Mode requirements
When using Custom View Controller Mode, you must remove the Conversation view when leaving the App. To avoid dismissing the View when presenting CSAT/SecureForms/PhotoSharing View, you should only dismiss the Conversation view if Moving From ParentView:

```swift
if (self.conversationQuery != nil && self.isMovingToParentViewController){
    LPMessagingSDK.instance.removeConversation(self.conversationQuery!)
}
```

When using ViewController Mode, on the Navigation Bar Back Button, you can simply call **LPMessagingSDK.instance.removeConversation(self.conversationQuery!)**.

### Step 1. Add app privacy settings

1. Set the photo library privacy settings:
   
   - **Key:** NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription
   
   - **Value:** "Photo Library Privacy Setting for LiveEngage Mobile App Messaging SDK for iOS"

2. Set the camera privacy settings:
   
   - **Key:** NSCameraUsageDescription
   
   - **Value:** "Camera Privacy Setting for LiveEngage Mobile App Messaging SDK for iOS"

{:.important}
Values for these descriptions are up to the brand to define, these are only examples.

### Step 2. Enable or disable photo sharing

1. Change the boolean value:

   ```swift
   LPConfig.defaultConfiguration.enablePhotoSharing
   ```

   By default, the value is set to **false**.

2. Contact your Account Team to have the feature enabled on your account.

### Step 3. Change the button text and color

- Change the background color of attachment menu:

   ```swift
   LPConfig.defaultConfiguration.photosharingMenuBackgroundColor
   ```

- Change the text of buttons:

   ```swift
   LPConfig.defaultConfiguration.photosharingMenuButtonsTextColor
   ```

- Change the menu button's background color:

   ```swift
   LPConfig.defaultConfiguration.photosharingMenuButtonsBackgroundColor
   ```

- Change the menu button's tint color:

   ```swift
   LPConfig.defaultConfiguration.photosharingMenuButtonsTintColor
   ```

You can find all the related configurations in the [resources ID table](consumer-experience-ios-sdk-attributes.html), under Photo Sharing.
