### Overview

iOS Mobile App SDK v3.5 contains fixes for high priority bugs reported by customers.

#### Environmental Requirements

iOS Mobile App SDK v3.5 is compatible with Xcode 10, Swift 4.2 and iOS versions 10 through 12

### Bugs

There is a known issue related to entering the conversation view controller with an expired token.  The consumer observes a "still connecting" message which can be resolved by exiting and re-entering the conversation view controller.

#### Bug Fixes


* When an unauthenticated consumer attempts to reconnect after their session expires (when using JSON Web Tokens) the connection fails.

* Push notifications are not being received when going to background (minimizing app) due to issues with network.

* When a consumer is in active conversation and an agent resolves the conversation, the unread message indicator appears but there are new messages visible and the consumer can not scroll down.

### API Update

* The LPInfraFacad method registerPusherWithLoginFlow(brand) has been updated to registerPusherWithLoginFlow(brand: Brand, authenticationParams: LPAuthenticationParams?) allowing for an optional 'Authentication Parameters' dictionary to be passed to aid in determining the status and routing of authentication for the current consumer.
