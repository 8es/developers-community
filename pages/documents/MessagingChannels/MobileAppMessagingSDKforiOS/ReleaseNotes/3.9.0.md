### Environmental Requirements

The iOS Mobile Messaging SDK version 3.9 is compatible with Xcode 10.2.1, Swift version 5.0.1 (swiftlang-1001.0.82.4 clang-1001.0.46.5), and supported on iOS versions 10 through 12.

### New Features

#### Photo sharing (agent-to-consumer)


#### File sharing 


### Bug fixed

**Reported in SDK 3.7.1 on iOS.** When the customer sent messages just before their current token expires, the agent did not receive one or more of the messages, resulting in data loss.  After the initial token expires, the system should issue another token to reconnect and send all messages regardless if the token expires or not.
