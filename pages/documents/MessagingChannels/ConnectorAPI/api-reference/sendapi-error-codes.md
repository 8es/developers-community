<div class="important">The error response format described here will be available in the next release.</div>

The SEND API returns an error response for every authorization or authentication failure. Such an error response contains a JSON payload which details the error, error title, details about the error and both an HTTP error code (401) and a specific code for the type of error encountered. For example, if the AppJWT is missing, then the Send API will return the following response:

```json
{
  "kind": "resp",
  "code": 401,
  "body": {
    "title": "AppJWT is missing",
    "details": "AUTHORIZATION header is not present",
    "errorCode": 40104
  },
  "type": ".ReqBody$ErrorResp"
}
```
