Most user actions within LiveEngage can be performed programmatically using the REST API. Since we use a REST model, we recommend you be fluent in:

- JavaScript, and its iterations like Node.JS, as well as JSON. Although most JSON payloads tend to be simple, there are exceptions to this rule, like with Structured Content. 
- Swift and Java, respectively, for Mobile App Messaging SDKs for iOS and Android.
- HTTP calls and responses, REST APIs, server to server communication and web applications.
- Retrieving information and data analysis/research for the Data APIs.

Also, if you have not already done so:

- Read the [API Terms of Use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou). 
- Read the [Systems Requirements and Language Support](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Sys+req/System+requirements.pdf) guide.

And before you can do anything, you must do a few things first. By the end of this Getting Started guide, you will be ready to customize and implement features in LiveEngage.
