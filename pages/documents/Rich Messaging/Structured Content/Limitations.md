### Maps

Both the web window (visitor side) and the workspace (agent side) do not show map by user-specific location but instead shows a static snapshot, the default map view defined.

### Styling

#### Mobile

1. Only the following parameters can be configured in Bubble branding when using the In-App SDK. All other attributes are inherited from the SDK configuration:

    1. Card border width

    2. Card border color

{:start="2"}
2. Structured content JSON affects text formatting in the structured content "Text" element but only the following parameters can be configured for the "Text" element:

* Font size

* Font style (Italic, Bold)

* Font color

* Background color

#### Web (Chat/Messaging)

You cannot customize the branding of the structured content bubble in the web window view. Cards may be branded using the JSON schema only.
