### Introduction

The LiveEngage Messaging Window API includes a file sharing feature. This feature enables consumers to share files with agents, such as images.


A typical flow of setting up the file sharing feature using the Messaging Window API:

1. Enable file sharing capability

2. Create a conversation

3. Request an upload URL

4. Upload the file to storage

5. Publish the file as a message inside the conversation  

6. Request a download URL

7. Download file from storage


We will examine and explain each stage in detail.

**Note:** If you would like to follow the steps using bash, please see the [Prerequisites document](consumer-int-get-msg.html#prerequisites).
