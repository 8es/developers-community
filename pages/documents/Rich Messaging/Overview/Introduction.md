Our solution allows sending messages (both Chat and Messaging channels) in a variety of ways: you can send simple text and images, or use our structured content templates to build your own layout with images, buttons and multiple actions in one message.
The following document lists the different types of entries available for use with such a layout and includes templates for how to write them in JSON.

You can use [this tool](https://livepersoninc.github.io/json-pollock/editor/) to render your JSON in advance and get a sense of how your structured content object will look.
