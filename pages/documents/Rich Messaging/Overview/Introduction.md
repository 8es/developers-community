Our solution allows sending messages (both Chat and Messaging channels) in a variety of ways: you can send simple text and images, or use our structured content templates to build your own layout with images, buttons and multiple actions in one message.

### Basic Elements
Basic elements are the core components of the structured content messaging template.
By using this element in your template, you can send basic messages, such as simple text, images or buttons.
You can also send a Structured Content template which includes multiple basic elements with attached actions.

Types of basic elements supported by the platform:

* Text
* Button
* Image
* Map

### Click operations
An element which has an "actions" field, an on-click operation (executed when the consumer clicks on the element) and a metadata field.

### Styling
Each basic element can have style elements.



The following document lists the different types of entries available for use with such a layout and includes templates for how to write them in JSON.
You can use [this tool](https://livepersoninc.github.io/json-pollock/editor/) to render your JSON in advance and get a sense of how your structured content object will look.
