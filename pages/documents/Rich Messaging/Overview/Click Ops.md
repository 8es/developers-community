On-click operations can result from two object types:

| Actions | List of actions to execute (Navigate/Link/publish text) | action | N | 4 actions per element |
| Metadata | list of UMS predefined objects to send back to the agent |  | N |  |

### Actions

Actions are a list of applicative actions that will run on the consumer side and will help them to achieve some kind of an operation. For instance: navigate with one of the navigation apps to a predefined place.

**Note**: Only button, image and map objects can receive the actions field.

Types of actions supported by the platform:

* Navigate

* Link

* Publish Text

#### Navigate

This actions has two use cases:

* Web: open google maps with the location.

* Mobile: navigate to the location with one of the navigation apps.

#### Link

Open a URL in a web view when opened in mobile, or in a new tab for web. This action can be used for deep link purposes.

Each environment can override the URI for their specific needs.

	"android": {
		"uri": "specific uri for Android"
	},
	"web": {
		"uri": "specific uri for Web"
	}
}
```

#### Publish Text

In order to support sending a message as a response for a button click, we introduced a new action called "Publish Text".
This action allows the brand to send a message on behalf of the consumer that will appear in the transcript.

This action will be used also by the clients (Mobile, VX) to send a response when a button was clicked.

##### **Fields**

**Example**

```json
 {
   "type": "publishText",
   "text": "text to send on behalf of the consumer"
 }
```

### Metadata

Metadata is a list of UMS predefined objects that can be sent back to the agent and be used in reporting. Metadata must be used inside a click block. For a more in depth guide on how metadata in Structured Content works, please refer to the [Conversation Metadata guide](https://developers.liveperson.com/guides-conversation-metadata-guide.html).


### Example

```json
"click": {
	"metadata": [
		{
			"type": "ExternalId",
			"id": "someID"
		}
	],
	"actions": [
