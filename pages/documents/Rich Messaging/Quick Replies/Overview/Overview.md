Quick Replies are a group of actionable items (chips) that appear as part of the conversation, making it easier to have an automated conversation with consumers.

It creates an easy way to enrich the consumerâ€™s experience and provide a direction for conversations using bot interactions.

It gives consumers brief answers that they can tap in the conversation to easily respond to messages.

When a Quick Reply chip is tapped, the items are dismissed.

The agent can see the Quick Replies group at all times, even if it is no longer visible to the consumer.
