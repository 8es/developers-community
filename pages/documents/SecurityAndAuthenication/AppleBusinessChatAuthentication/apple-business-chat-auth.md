## Applying Authentication Interactive Message in Structured Content Framework - **New!**

### Overview

* Business Chat nows supports the new OOTB Interactive Message that allows brands to authenticate their consumers using their OAuth 2.0 provider (only from iOS 12 onwards)

* The brands will use their private OAuth service and will supply the service details in their Apple management area (register.apple.com). The details include:  Authentication endpoint URL, Token URL, Client Identifier

* LiveEngage will support agent/bot generation of the new Authentication Interactive Message using the Structured Content framework and configuration (similar to list and time picker)

* Agent/bot will know if consumer supports the new Authentication Message via an engagement attribute, in order to determine if the consumer is qualified to receive the authentication message before sending it (a new SDE will be exposed with the Authentication supportability).

* Consumer will receive the Authentication Interactive Message and will be able to tap to authenticate on the brand’s Authentication service URL

* Agents and bots on LiveEngage will get real-time updates upon a consumer’s response

* Upon successful or failed authentication, LiveEngage will support passing the authentication status and token back to LiveEngage [Conversational Metadata](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-agent-sdk-conversation-metadata-guide.html) (via the agent SDK) to allow the brand to perform validation on the authentication information.

### Authentication Interactive Message Request via Structured Content

#### Authentication Interactive Message - Structured Content Body

The structured content body will allow you to define the layout of the Authentication Interactive Message bubble representation in the agent workspace transcript as structured content basic elements.

Please note that the structured content body layout will not be represented on the consumer’s message thread, but rather the Interactive Message bubble which is determined by the structured content metadata. The body will help the brand create a visual representation in LiveEngage of the Authentication Interactive Message that was sent (for conversational context, transcript and historic records, as well as ease of use for agents).

For full instructions on the structured content body field descriptions and different layout options please refer to the [structured content guide in our dev community. ](https://developers.liveperson.com/structured-content-templates.html)

#### Authentication Interactive Message - Structured Content Metadata

Sending Authenticated Interactive Messages with structured content is supported via the metadata. Through the structured content metadata brands can set and control the visual appearance of the authentication received and reply bubble layout in the Business Chat conversation, and define the authentication request identifier.

**BusinessChatMessage - ****receivedMessage and replyMessage bubbles**
The Business Chat Message holds the received and reply message, which defines how the Authentication Interactive Message bubbles layout will be displayed when the message is received on the consumer’s device and a an authentication is submitted by the consumer.

**ConnectorAuthenticationRequest**

The authentication request holds the request identifier, which allows the brand to identify the authentication request and map the OAuth token in the response to the request originator.

Please use the structured content metadata JSON with the relevant fields, as presented in the example JSON below.

##### Authentication Interactive Message is constructed with the following Metadata Properties:

##### Authentication Interactive Message - Structured Content Metadata JSON Example:

[  

  {  

    **"type"**:"BusinessChatMessage",

    **"receivedMessage"**:{  

      **"title"**:"Sign In to LivePerson",

      **"subtitle"**:"Thank you",

### Authentication Interactive Message Response

After the consumer submits their authentication details in the authentication interactive message, the interactive message response is delivered to LiveEngage using the [Conversional Metadata](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-agent-sdk-conversation-metadata-guide.html), which provides a way for developers and partners that are building an agent bot using the Messaging Agent SDK to pass metadata or context information on a conversation.

This is the new Conversational Metadata type that will support the Authentication Interactive Message Response:

#### Authentication Response

Authentication response metadata is context information of the consumer authentication response status. This information should be used to allow the bot to validate the authentication status of the consumer, as well as to enable the bot to report the auth response token back to the brand’s OAuth service in order to validate user identity.

**Type****:** ConnectorAuthenticationResponse

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Property Name</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Status</td>
    <td>Status of the consumer authentication - can be only true (successful) or false (failed) </td>
    <td>Boolean </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>token</td>
    <td>Token string - will be available only when authentication was successful </td>
    <td>String</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>errors</td>
    <td>Type of authentication error as received from Apple - will be available only when authentication failed </td>
    <td>Array</td>
  </tr>
</table>




##### Authentication Interactive Message - Example Conversational Metadata response:

###### Success example response:

{  

  **"type"**:"ConnectorAuthenticationResponse",

  **"status"**:true,

  **"token"**:"Token String"

}

###### Failure example response:

{  

  **"type"**:"ConnectorAuthenticationResponse",

  **"status"**:false,

  **"errors"**:[  

    {  

      **"message"**:"applicable apple error codes"

    }

  ]

}

#### Important notes

* The agent or bot will know if the consumer supports the Authentication capability via the "role" SDE:

    * If consumer device supports authentication, value will be: "Apple Authentication supported"

    * If consumer device does not support authentication, value will be: "Apple Authentication not supported"

    * Please note: If the consumers updates the iOS version from 11 to 12 when still in an active conversation in LiveEngage, the conversation will not be updated with the consumer’s new capability - to solve this, the conversation should be closed and opened again in LiveEngage.

* Received and reply bubble experience:

    * If brand is using received bubble with style "icon", “small”, “large” -

            * Received bubble experience - If image was added, the image in the received bubble will not be presented in the push preview message. Once the brand will tap to view bubble in the conversation thread, the image will be presented. The size of the received bubble will be defaulted to "icon"

            * Reply bubble experience -  Image will always be defaulted to the "received" bubble image (if configured), if no image was added to the received bubble, no image will be presented in the reply bubble. The size of the reply bubble will be defaulted to “icon”.

            * If authentication fails, the Reply bubble text and subtitle configured will be overridden by apple to the following text "Authentication failed"

* Image URLs must be whitelisted in LiveEngage - Images added in the RecievedMessage and ReplyMessage must be whitelisted in the structured content image whitelisting area. Please contact you LP representative to whitelist images.

#### Limitations

* In the current version of Authentication Interactive Message support, only a bot in LiveEngage (using the Agent SDK) will be able to receive the authentication response (using the Conversation Metadata). Human Agent is currently not exposed to these events. Adding UI indication in LiveEngage Workspace is planned for Q4, 2018

* Currently any Business Chat conversation are appearing as authenticated conversation in LiveEngage (once the consumer authenticates using the interactive message the conversation status of will stay the same) - Changing the Business Chat conversation status to unauthenticated is planned for Q1, 2018.  

### Instructions on how to create a free OAuth2 service using [auth0](https://auth0.com/) -

1. Create a [auth0 account](https://auth0.com/)

2. Create a new Application Machine to Machine

3. Put [https://auth.businesschat.apple.com](https://auth.businesschat.apple.com) in Allowed Callback Urls

4. Put [https://auth.businesschat.apple.com](https://auth.businesschat.apple.com) in Allowed Origins & Allowed Web Origins

5. On the same screen, go to the bottom and select advanced settings -> Endpoints

6. Copy Auth URL, Token Url, Client Secret (It is at the top) and put it in your register.apple.com portal

7. Once Apple approves the new auth details, use the Structured Content to trigger the Bubble.
