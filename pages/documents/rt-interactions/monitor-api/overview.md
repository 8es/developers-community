### Introduction
** Sivan **

**Note**: This API works for engagements only of the APP_INSTALL, MSDK and CHAT_API type with the same app-installation-id. If you do not have an engagement of either of these types, this API **will not work**. If you attempt to use this API on other types of engagements (for example, offsite or website engagements), the API calls will fail.

### High Level Concepts
* HTTP based - All information (both client to server and server to client) will be passed using an HTTP request-response model
* HTTPS only - Only **secured** (SSL) requests will be handled
* JSON based - All data (both directions) will be passed using a valid JSON
* Same URL Path - All HTTP requests will be sent with the same URL path (query params may be different) 

### Important Disclaimer
The "Monitor API" is a **stateful API**. The identifier of the API's state (AKA - session / context) is a pair of 2 parameters - 'vid' and 'sid'. It is highly (!) recommended to provide a valid value to both these parameters when accessing this resource:
- A response code of **200 (OK)** 		- means that the values of the 'vid' and 'sid' query parameters that were provided are valid - the pair represents a valid state.
- A response code of **201 (CREATED)** 	- means that no values were provided for the 'vid' and/or the 'sid' query parameters, or the values provided are otherwise invalid - therefore, a new state was created, which is represented by the 'vid' and 'sid' pair that appears in the response body.

### Forward Compatibility
* Clients should not rely on a closed set of attributes since the format is JSON (no exceptions on marshaling objects).

### Authentication and Authorization
This API is public and doesn’t require authentication or authorization.

### Use Cases 
** Sivan **

### Capping
TODO: write the context, consult with Eitan/Miki regarding the capping section
* If the limit of events per session was reached, this session will be blocked and a new one will be created
* When reached limit of sessions per account, an 5XX response will be sent back to client
* When reached limit of sessions per visitor, an 5XX response will be sent back to client

### Validation
* When providing consumerId/CustomerInfo.customerId, should send only one or verify they match (parameter and engagement attribute) 
* When providing lpConsumerId/LPConsumer.id, should send only one or verify it matches (parameter and engagement attribute)  

### Happy Flow

### Error handling
Any http error or timeout must be handled by a client as general error and retry according to its retry policy.
In case of unsuccessful http response (not 2xx code) the client must read all messages and handle errors according to the following definitions:
* Error may be sent from a server at any point. 
* First number in the error code defines the general meaning of the error. 4 meaning for client error, and 5 meaning of server error.

#### Response Errors
| Status code | Internal code | Description | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 400 | 33 | Illegal API version | |
| 400 | 5 | Mandatory data is missing or invalid, parsing error | Request body is not a valid JSON, one or more SDE’s cannot be parsed, input validation errors |
| 404 | 37 | Invalid or unknown visitor id | Visitor ID must be valid for PUT method |
| 404 | 39 | Invalid or unknown session id | Session ID must be valid for PUT method |
| 404 |  | App installation Id | App installation id must be valid |
| 500 | 20 | Account not loaded or request timed out | First request for new account |
| 500 | 18 | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server error |
