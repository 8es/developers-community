### Introduction
The "Monitor API" is meant to serve the consumer monitoring and engaging flows. In order to present a "Click to Message" button (an engagement) with an updated state of availability, the LivePerson monitoring system must be accessed in order to create a monitor session and reply with an engagement. By doing so, the monitoring system tracks the consumer activity within the brand's system and engages the consumer based on campaign definitions.   

### Terminology
* consumer - TBD
* `consumerId` - the brand's identifier for the consumer (e.g, email, phone number or a generated unique id)
* consumer device - TBD
* monitor session - the server-side state of the current consumer device session
* `visitorId` - the LivePerson identifier to the current consumer device 
* `sessionId` - the LivePerson identifier to the current monitor session of this consumer device
* `appInstallationId` - TBD
* campaign - TBD
* engagement - TBD

### A sample flow:
1. The consumer device sends a request to the [Engagement Resource](rt-interactions-engagement.html){:target="_blank"}. 
** the above request can be added with the following information regarding consumer activity within the brand's system -  `consumerId`, entry points, engagement attributes, client properties, etc'...
2. The monitoring system creates a monitor session for this consumer device and replies with an eligible engagement, including the `visitorId` and a `sessionId` in the response.
3. The consumer device sends a request to the [Report Resource](rt-interactions-report.html){:target="_blank"}, specifying the `visitorId` and a `sessionId` in the request, in order to report about the status of the engagement usage - displayed, clicked, etc'... 

### Notes (!)
The "Monitor API" is a **stateful API**. This (server-side) state is the monitor session, identified by a pair of 2 parameters - `visitorId` and a `sessionId`. In order to maintain consistency, maintain a proper funnel and avoid unnecessary load, it is highly (!) advisable to provide the `sessionId` and `visitorId`, that are created in the first request for a consumer device monitor session, in all subsequent requests to all resources of the "Monitor API":

* A response code of **200 (OK)** 		- means that the values of the `visitorId` and a `sessionId` that were provided are valid - the pair represents a valid monitor session.
* A response code of **201 (CREATED)** 	- means that no values were provided for the `visitorId` and/or `sessionId` query parameters, or the values provided are otherwise invalid - therefore, a new monitor session was created (the new `visitorId` and  `sessionId` appear in the response body).

### Protocols
* HTTP based - All information (both client to server and server to client) will be passed using an HTTP request-response model
* HTTPS only - Only **secured** (SSL) requests will be handled
* JSON based - All data (both directions) will be passed using a valid JSON. **Note** - clients should not rely on a closed set of attributes since the format is JSON ("Forward Compatibility").

### Authentication and Authorization
This API is public. When specifying `appInstallationId` and `accountId`, it does not require any further authentication or authorization only simple id validation.

### Usage, Capping and Error handling
* In order to avoid unnecessary load, **it is highly (!) advisable to provide the `sessionId` and `visitorId` of the consumer device** in all subsequent requests (e.g. the 2nd request onwards) spanning the current monitor session.
* Not complying to the above usage of the `sessionId` and `visitorId` parameters may lead to an exceptional (abnormal) rate of monitor sessions' creation which will eventually be capped and will result in erroneous 5XX responses.    

#### Response Errors
| Status code | Internal code | Description | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 400 | 33 | illegal API version requested | |
| 400 | 5 | request data is missing or invalid | request body is not a valid JSON ; input does not meet validation requirements; input cannot be parsed ... |
| 404 | 37 | invalid visitorId | |
| 404 | 39 | invalid sessionId | |
| 404 | 18 | invalid appInstallationId | |
| 500 | 20 | account not loaded or request timed out | |
| 500 | 18 | internal server error | an unexpected server error occurred |

### Use Cases 
** Sivan **

### Reporting funnel:
Today, Report Builder offers a set of operational and funnel reports which instill visibility into campaign performance, and agent performance against campaign goals. These reports currently cover both Chats and Messaging conversation types from Web sources. 
Now a selection of dashboards have been expanded to reflect on the performance of campaigns which include a mix of engagements from web and non-web source.

**This expansion includes**
1. Opening the Business Activity dashboard to additional sources (non-web = Mobile App, Facebook, SMS, etc.)
2. Aligning goal tracking from non-web sources to the existing web based attribution model
3. Adding source type filtering to the Business Activity, Goal Tracker, and Agent Activity dashboards
4. Aligning the terminology of funnel metrics to serve all sources
