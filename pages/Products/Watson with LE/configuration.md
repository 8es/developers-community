### Bot as an agent setup

For Watson to perform like any other human agent in your contact center team, we need to ensure LiveEngage is facilitating operational management and efficiency for Watson as an agent. As an agent user, Watson acts as an agent / agent manager with all the relevant permissions. It can also be tracked and managed in the same way as any other human agent. To enable automation, the bot user will be able to login automatically.

Within LiveEngage, this means the following activities apply:

* User creation: a user is created for Watson, with the type 'bot’

* Monitoring: Watson conversations are measure in the same way as human agent conversations

    * When a conversation with Watson begins, it automatically appears in the 'Active Connections’ tab within LiveEngage

    * Watson is measured on the same real time KPIs agents are

    * Managers can click into the conversation and read the transcript in real time

* MCS: Watson, along with human agents, is monitored and measured with the Meaningful Connection Score, providing real time sentiment analysis

* Reporting: All data and reports available for agents are automatically available for Watson

You should first **create a skill to be used only by the bot**. This will enable LiveEngage to route conversations appropriately and is also critical for reporting and analysis.

**To create a skill:**

1. Click on the users tab.

2. Click on Skills to view the Skills list.

3. Click Add Skill.

4. The Add skill dialog box will open.

5. Name the new skill and type in a description.

Note: the name given to the skill should be clear and easy to track, for example 'watson-bot’.

6. Set the maximum wait time (in seconds) that you’re allowing your visitors to wait for agents with this skill. This ensures that your agents are fully occupied, yet not overextended, and that visitors won't wait longer than the maximum wait time.

7. Click Save.

For further information, refer to the [Skills documentation](https://ce-sr.s3.amazonaws.com/CA/Admin/skills/29_Skills.pdf).

You must also **create a bot type user**. The bot user can be configured with roles and permissions, in the same way as a human agent, and its performance will be tracked and reflected in reporting by LiveEngage.

**To create a bot type user:**

1. In the users tab, click on 'new user’.

2. In the *User type* dropdown select **Bot**.

3. Select the avatar and name for your bot.

4. In the *login method** *dropdown select **API key**, then click the **Generate** button.  The key will later be used in the Connector configuration.

5. Assign the relevant skill and agent group.

6. Set the maximum number of messaging conversations.

Note: You must have admin or campaign manager permissions in order to create a bot type user.


#### Setup the connector

Onboarding the Watson connector is a two-part process, involving obtaining and entering Watson’s credentials and configuring the LiveEngage account to ensure it is enabled to facilitate Watson activity. This includes:

* creating a new LiveEngage user

* adding automatic messages

* defining default skills for escalation and failure

* completing intent to skill mapping

Your LivePerson team will support you with all of the backend configuration for your Watson connector. During this process, they will consult with you to ensure Watson is setup to reflect the brand image and consumer experience you want to deliver. This includes determining content for the following entities:

**Auto messages**

A number of automatic messages are required to display during certain scenarios, such as when Watson is not responding or when the conversation is escalated to a human agent.

**Skills**

To ensure the experience is always smooth for the consumer, default skills need to be mapped for Watson, in case of escalation or bot failure, or if skill mapping was not properly completed.

**Skill to intent mapping**

Mapping capabilities defined in Watson to the skills defined in LiveEngage is an important step to ensure the consumer has a seamless experience when interacting with the bot. Once the mapping is complete, upon an escalation the conversation will automatically be routed to the most appropriate skill.

#### Define the human agent workflow

For bot and human agents to work together effectively, the transition between bot and human must be seamless. Watson must be able to escalate a conversation to a human agent at appropriate points in the conversation, while agents and agent managers must also be able to step into the conversation at any time if they identify an issue.

**Bot to agent escalation**

* Automatic: Watson can identify and push an escalation based on intent, customer request or unsupported use case.

* Seamless: Both consumers and agents continue to use the same window and view the entire history and context of the conversation.

* Transparent: Consumers clearly see the avatar reflecting who they speak with. In addition, system messages communicate the status of the transfer.

* Availability check: Before routing to an agent, LiveEngage performs availability checks to ensure that agents within the identified skill are available. Relevant messages are conveyed to customers.

* Reporting: LiveEngage will report on the escalations and their reasons to help brands understand where and how to optimize Watson.

Watson should be treated as any other agent in the contact center team, and tracked and monitored accordingly. The following steps should be taken to establish the Watson - human agent workflow:

**Assign a human manager to Watson:**

It’s important to determine which agents or agent managers will monitor the bot in real time.

Enable the Takeover conversation permission:

1. Adjust the profile permissions of the agent or agent manager(s) to include the *Takeover conversation* permission. This will enable the agent or agent manager to takeover the conversation at any time from the bot, meaning they can step in

Note: If you would like to enable the *Takeover* *conversation *permission for some agents or agent managers, but not for others, this can be achieved by creating a new custom profile within the relevant role. For further information, refer to the [Customize user profiles documentation](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ce-sr/CA/Admin/Permissions+(profiles).pdf).

2. Assign the created bot user to the human manager’s agent group.

**Pending agent response after transfer to skill**

When a human or bot agent transfers a conversation they are handling to a different skill, the conversation will automatically be set to pending agent response, regardless of which participant (agent or consumer) was the last one to respond within the conversation. This will ensure that when a bot transfers or escalates the conversation to an agent, it will be considered as an 'active' conversation by smart capacity and auto close, and treated accordingly.

Transferring to a different skill will also reset the conversation’s response time, which is displayed to the consumer and to agents. The KPIs on the real-time data bar will also update to reflect that a conversation is pending the agent’s response.
