The following steps need to be taken prior to configuring the Watson connector with LiveEngage:

1. **Setup Watson:** The Watson Virtual Agent (WVA) should be setup and configured (via IBM Global Business Service or a certified LivePerson professional service engineer).

2. **Define your bot persona:** You will need to develop a persona, name and avatar for the bot, to match your understanding of your consumerâ€™s needs and the brand experience you want to communicate via the bot.

3. **Enable LiveEngage account**: Messaging must be preconfigured on your account, along with the messaging channels you wish to use. LiveEngage offers in-app messaging, web messaging and messaging via Facebook, SMS and Google My Business. Please contact your LivePerson account team to ensure messaging and Watson are fully enabled on your account.

4. **Auto messages & Predefined Content:** You will need to define appropriate text for auto messages and predefined content, to ensure the consumer experience when communicating with a bot is as well-informed and seamless as possible.

5. **Define routing logic:** In order to assign incoming conversations from the mapped bot journies to the bot skill, the brand should work with LivePerson CS to configure automatic skill selection.
