The Watson with LiveEngage Connector provides an always available messaging connection for brands and consumers. The connector acts as a communication channel between LiveEngage and Watson APIs, offering top-of-the-line security and enterprise-ready scale.

Watson integrates with the LiveEngage platform, logging in as an agent with the ability to answer conversations concurrently. The Watson with LiveEngage Connector can be used across all messaging channels, reaching consumers from SMS, web messaging, Facebook Messenger, and more.

### What is the Watson Connector?

Watson provides the artificial intelligence solution to power chatbots, and to understand the intent of the consumer. This means it can take on a significant amount of work in the contact center, freeing up human agents for more complex tasks and higher levels of consumer care.  

Because it runs on LiveEngage, the bot seamlessly routes the conversation to a human agent when it cannot understand the consumer. This 'hybrid bot’ approach with Watson’s technology allows agents and agent managers to monitor interactions, and also see full conversation history to better assist customers if a transition from a bot to human agent is made.

By treating the bot as any other human agent, the connector enables brands enjoy all the benefits the LiveEngage platform brings, from agent and agent manager workspace tools, to performance tracking and detailed reporting and analysis.  Our connector allows the rapid and efficient deployment of this bot activity at the scale required by the world’s largest brands.

### Terminology

* **Cognitive care**: Artificial intelligence and virtual agents are leveraged to take consumer care to a more intuitive and smart level.

* **WVA or Watson**: Watson Virtual Agent, a cognitive, conversational bot that can provide answers and perform actions.

* **Bot**: An application that performs an automated task, and can be used in LiveEngage to deal with simple, repetitive processes such as routing and providing basic services like account balance and address change.

* **Connector**: Developed jointly by IBM and LivePerson, the connector allows custom data and bot resolutions to be passed and enables intent-to-skill mapping. It applies to all messaging channels.

* **Virtual Agent**: Powered by artificial intelligence, a virtual agent is able to perform some of the roles of a human agent.

* **Intent**: The intent, defined by the consumer’s activity or response to a question, determines their objective.

### Benefits

What are the key benefits for brands of integrating Watson with LiveEngage?

* **A presence on all messaging channels:** Watson with LiveEngage is available on all messaging channels, from Mobile App Messaging to web messaging to SMS.

* **Top of the line security and enterprise scale:** LiveEngage provides a secure platform for enterprise business, including PCI security standards that provide real-time, customizable masking of sensitive data.

* **Simple onboarding:** The out-of-the-box connector reduces implementation efforts by 60% compared to manual implementation. No additional development is needed.
