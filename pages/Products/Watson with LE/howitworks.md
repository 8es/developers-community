Watson is integrated seamlessly into the LiveEngage platform, ensuring that from the moment a consumer initiates a conversation, LiveEngage analyzes and evaluates a series of parameters to ensure the consumer is directed to the right agent, be it Watson or a human agent.

Once assigned to a bot agent, the conversation will be handled by the bot, until it is resolved by one of the following actions:

* The bot resolves the conversation

* The bot escalates it to a human agent

* An agent manager manually takes over the conversation

An escalation from a bot to a human agent can occur in three situations:

* By design, based on the intent

* When Watson is unable to identify the intent

* By consumer request

When a conversation is escalated, it is particularly important that the consumer is routed rapidly and accurately from Watson to the most appropriate agent. LiveEngage selects the appropriate skill based on the intent identified by the bot, performs an availability check immediately upon escalation and and displays the relevant message to the consumer.
