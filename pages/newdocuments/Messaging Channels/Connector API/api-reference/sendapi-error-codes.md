The API returns an error response for every authentication failure. Such an error response, contains a JSON payload which details the error reason. For example, if the AppJWT is missing, then the Send API will return the following response:

```json
{
  "kind": "resp",
  "code": 401,
  "body": {
    "title": "AppJWT is missing",
    "details": "AUTHORIZATION header is not present",
    "errorCode": 40104
  },
  "type": ".ReqBody$ErrorResp"
}
```
