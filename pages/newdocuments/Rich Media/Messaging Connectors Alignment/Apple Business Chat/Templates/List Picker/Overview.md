[Business Chat List Picker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/businesschat/enhancing_the_customer_s_user_experience/sending_a_list_picker) enables human or automated agents to share a list of items and information about them while allowing the consumer to select multiple items and reply back with the selection. The following capabilities are supported:

* Define items information - item name, description, image.

* Item sections - divide your list of items into sections based on the product categories.

* Multi-selection - Allow the consumer to select multiple items.

* receivedMessage and replyMessage bubbles style structures - define the layouts for the bubbles that are received by the consumer on the Business Chat thread, and replied to.

Using metadata fields, brands can define the received and reply bubble structures and enable multi-selection capabilities.

Below is an image example of a Business Chat List Picker with multi-selection turned on:
