Quick Replies are a group of actionable items (chips) that appear as part of the conversation, making it easier to have an automated conversation with consumers. Once a consumer clicks on one of these chips, a pre-rendered message is sent to a bot, without the consumer having to type it out. This saves the consumer precious time and creates an easy way to enrich the consumerâ€™s experience and provide a direction for conversations using bot interactions. Because these answers are pre-formatted, it enables a bot to continue the conversation freely and smoothly.

LiveEngage enables creating and displaying up to 24 Quick Replies chips per message (that is, a consumer will have up to 24 chips to choose from per message they'll send).

Each chip can have:

* **Title:** up to 25 characters (above 25, LiveEngage's default client like the Mobile App SDK will insert an ellipsis after 22 and obscure the rest of the text. If you're building your own client, you can handle this as you'd like, defining your own character limit)

* **Click operation:** with actions and metadata

* **Styling elements:** for full branding and styling needs

When a Quick Reply chip is tapped, the rest of the chips are dismissed. The agent can see the entirety of the Quick Replies group at all times, even if it is no longer visible to the consumer (after they click on a chip for example).
