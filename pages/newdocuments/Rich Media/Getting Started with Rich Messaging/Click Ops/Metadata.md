Metadata is a list of UMS predefined objects that can be sent back to the agent and be used in reporting. Metadata must be used inside a click block. For a more in depth guide on how metadata in Structured Content works, please refer to the [Conversation Metadata guide](guides-conversation-metadata-guide.html).

**Note:** when using our APIs to communicate as a consumer (for example, by using the Messaging Window API or the Connector API), metadata should always be added to an action. This is so that our services have an indication that an element was clicked. The metadata should be sent as part of 'AcceptStatusEvent' with the assigned status of 'ACTION'. For more information on 'AcceptStatusEvent' and its status field, please see the [Messaging Window API](agent-int-api-reference.html).

If the type of action is 'publishText' (see above for an example), the metadata should be attached to the 'ContentEvent' as well.
This is so that a certain text which is published is associated with the click which sent it.
