## LivePerson Developers' Community

**As of August 2018, please open all Pull Requests DIRECTLY TO THE MASTER BRANCH**

This repository generates LivePerson's Developers' Community, which can be found at https://developers.liveperson.com. The site is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you find an issue with the documentation, site structure, meta or anything else, please open an issue and we'll respond as soon as possible!

### Updating the Documentation

All pages on the site correspond to a Markdown file (.md) which can be found inside the "pages" folder, under the "documents" folder. To update a file, please branch off of a master, edit the file in question and create a Pull Request **back to the master branch**. There's no need for the old Development branch, so please don't create pull requests to it.

#### Updating/Creating Headers

Jekyll uses a [front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) to arrange the various documents in the site under a hierarchy or navigation. This is the text which appears in between the "---" at the top of each document. It's technically a YAML snippet, so all YAML formatting and rules apply to it. Our headers are usually comprised of the following key/value pairs:

* `title`: this is the name of the page that will appear at the top of the document.

* `keywords`: this replaces the keywords found in the `<meta>` tag of the page. Leave it unpopulated.

* `level1`: this key can have either "Documents" or "Solutions". This designates which part of the site the document is under.

* `level2`: this is the category to which the document's API belongs (for example, the "Create Users" method belongs to the Users API which is under Admin. Therefore, it's level2 is "Admin".

* `level3`: this is the API to which the document belongs.

* `level4`: this is a sub-folder to which the document belongs, if there is one.

* `root-link`: this key accepts a Boolean value. If set to `true`, the document will be the "top" document for the API and all links to the API from the navigation will lead to it.

* `level-order`: this key accepts an integer. If `root-link` is set to `true`, this key positions the parent API among its category. It is sequential, so 1 will display before 2 and 2 before 3 and so on. Thus, if the Users API (which is under Admin) has an "Overview" page that has `root-link` set to `true` and `level-order` set to `1`, it will appears before the Skills API (which is also under Admin) which has an "Overview" page that has `root-link` set to `true` but a `level-order` set to `2`.

* `order`: this value accepts an integer. It arranges the documents inside the API. It is sequential, so 1 will display before 2 and 2 before 3 and so on. Note that it doesn't discriminate between folders, so even if you have `level4` defined for some documents, they are still placed on the same sequence as the rest of the documents.

* `permalink`: this key defines the link at which the document can be found.

* `indicator`: this key sets the Chat or Messaging indicator (or both) on a document. It accepts "chat", "messaging" or "both".

### Building the Site Locally

If you have not already done so, make sure your computer has Ruby installed. Here's a helpful guide on how to do best do that on [Mac](http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html) (you can stop once Ruby is installed, you don't need Rails) and on [any other system](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Once you have installed Ruby, clone this repository to your machine. Once done, navigate to it using Terminal or your preferred command line interface. Follow these steps to run the site from your machine:

**First time install**

1. Run `bundle install`. This will install all the gems/plugins that the site depends on.
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll build`. This builds the `_site` folder for the first time on your machine. The `bundle exec` prefix makes sure that bundler "watches" your build and installs any dependencies that might be missing. It's a precaution and is thus not mandatory.
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This builds the site and serves it over localhost:4000 (by default, you can change the `port` parameter in config.yml to whatever port you'd prefer).
4. Navigate to http://localhost:4000/ (or the port you chose) and you'll see the site.

**Serving the site after the first install**

All you need to run in consequent builds of the site is `bundle exec jekyll serve`. You can add the suffix `--incremental` to enable incremental building of the site. This saves build times since the regeneration feature is enabled by default (the site rebuilds every time you hit "save"). When `--incremental` is used, Jekyll won't rebuild the entire site on every save, only the affected sections.

**Note**: changes that alter site navigation or other changes that change the site as a whole might not show up when using `--incremental`. If that occurs, simply "kill" the build and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` without the suffix.
